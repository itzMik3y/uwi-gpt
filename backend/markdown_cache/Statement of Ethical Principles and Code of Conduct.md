## STATEMENT OF ETHICAL PRINCIPLES/CODE OF CONDUCT

## PREAMBLE

- 1. The  University  of  the  West  Indies  is  a  self-regulating  regional  institution  established  by Royal  Charter  in  seventeen  English  Speaking  countries:  Anguilla,  Antigua,  Bahamas, Barbados,  Belize,  Bermuda,  British  Virgin  Islands,  Cayman  Islands,  Dominica,  Grenada, Jamaica, Montserrat, St. Kitts &amp; Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Trinidad &amp; Tobago and Turks &amp; Caicos Islands.
- 2. The University of the West Indies:
- (a) Provides  a  place  or  places  of  education,  learning  and  research  of  a  standard required  and  expected of  a  university  of  the  highest  standard,  and  seeks  to secure  the  advancement  of  knowledge  and  diffusion  and  extension  of  arts, science and learning throughout the contributing countries.
- (b) Continues  and  expands  its  work  and   activities  and,  by  the  example  and influence  of  its   corporate  life,   to  p romote wisdom and  u n d e r s t a n d i n g throughout  the  contributing  countries.  (The  Charter  of  the  University  of  the West Indies, article 2).
- 3. The University is committed to the highest standard of ethical conduct which is an integral part  of  its  mission  to  "foster  initiative,  integrity  and  excellence,  in  an  environment  of collegiality, civility and responsible stewardship." That commitment upholds the reputation of the University, both locally and globally.

## THE MISSION AND FUNCTIONS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF THE WEST INDIES

- 1. The  mission  of  the  University  of  the  West  Indies  is  to  unlock  the  great  potential  of  its students, staff and members for cultural, economic, intellectual, social and spiritual growth in  the  Caribbean, the African Diaspora, and the global environment  through high quality teaching  and  research.  The  University,  in  pursuit  of  its  mission  provides  an  active intellectual centre for the advancement of learning, the creation of knowledge and fosters innovation for the positive transformation of the Caribbean, the African Diaspora and the Wider World.
- 2. While its functions are to foster and conduct free enquiry and research and to engage in teaching in a disciplined and scholarly manner, the University recognizes that as a regional University  supported  primarily  by  the  Governments  and  peoples  of  the  West  Indies,  it should be equipped to meet local requirements, and should, in giving priority to regional needs  relate  its  own  developmental  programs  to  the  needs  of  the  Caribbean  as  far  as possible.
- 3. To  this  end,  the  University has  obligations to  assist  in  the  establishment  of  learned journals and societies, to help to institutionalize scholarship in these societies, and to assist in the formulation of social policy. In addition, University teachers may be asked, to bring their  professional  skills  and  talents  to  bear  on  the  many  problems  of  the  developing community.
- 4. As a result of the nature of the University as an institution of intellectual enquiry, members of the academic staff and professional staff require distinctive freedom in the use of their time  and  in  the  direction  of  their  enterprise;  at  the  same  time,  they  must  accept responsibility of ensuring that their time is well spent and that their enterprise is directed fruitfully. This  concept  of  freedom,  coupled  with  responsibility,  is  embodied  in  our university customs and traditions.

## OBJECTIVE OF THE CODE

- 1. This Code of Conduct sets out a number of Ethical and General Principles of behaviour and Good  Relationships  that  staff  and  members  of  the  University  are  to  comply  with  while performing their respective roles within the University. Consistent with the core values of integrity,  excellence,  gender  justice,  diversity  and  student  centeredness,  the  following Ethical Principles  form  an integral part of the University's modus operandi:
- (a) Equity and Justice
- (b) Gender Equality
- (c) Personal and Professional Responsibility
- (d) Integrity and Accountability

## APPLICATION OF THE CODE

- 1. The  Code  of  Ethics  and  Code  of  Conduct  form  part  of  the  University's  contract  of employment  with  its staff and applies to all officers, staff including independent contractor's    and  employees  of  the  University,  whether  full-time,  part-time  or  casual appointees,  and  to  all  members  of  the  University  Council,  Senate,  Finance  and  General Purposes Committee, Campus Finance and General Purpose Committees, Ethics Committees,  The  University  Audit  Committee,  The  University  Investment  and  Planning Committee and all committees that may from time to time be established.
- 2. The Code also applies to:
- (a) honorary and adjunct staff;
- (b) Visiting staff, and others acting in a voluntary capacity while participating in the life of the University community;
- (c) Contractors, their employees and representatives, and visitors engaging in any University-related activity.
- 3. Where conduct by a staff member, or any other applicable category of persons is below the standards outlined in the Statement of Ethical Principles and Code of Conduct , this may be classified  as  misconduct  which  will  be  dealt  with  in  accordance  with  Ordinance  8  where relevant and any other university rules and procedures.

## THE ETHICAL PRINCIPLES

The Statement of Ethical Principles/Code of Conduct is premised on four core ethical principles: Equity  and  Justice,  Gender  Equality,  Personal  and  Professional  Responsibilities,  and  Integrity and Accountability.

## 1. Equity and Justice

Equity and Justice are concerned with the prevention of abuses of power In a fair and just environment, all members are able to access opportunities that allow for full participation.

## 2. Gender Equality

The attainment of gender equality and justice is regarded as absolutely essential within a human rights based framework. As The UWI recognises and upholds the human rights of all of  its  stakeholders,  The  UWI  has  expressed in its Gender Policy  recognises the rights and responsibilities of all its constituents, irrespective of categories of difference including but not  limited  to  sex,  gender  identity,  sexual  orientation,  race/ethnicity,  ability/disability, religion, age, socioeconomic status, nationality or place of origin. Refer to The UWI Gender Policy .

The  University  of  the  West-Indies  is  an  equal  opportunity  institution.  Accordingly,  sexual harassment,  an  aspect  of  gender  discrimination,  is  expressly  prohibited  and  will  not  be tolerated.

The  University  of  the  West  Indies  will  reflect  this  policy  of  non-tolerance  of  sexual harassment  in  the  oversight  of  its  students,  employees,  persons  under  its  independent service arrangements, other persons who provide academic services to the University, as well as to its contractual agreements, and its interaction with members of the public. See Revised Policy on Sexual Harassment 2015.

## 3. Personal and Professional Responsibilities

The responsibilities of a staff member are essentially determined by the responsibilities and commitments which the University itself undertakes in order to fulfill its role in society. The University,  as  an  institution  of  intellectual  enquiry,  functions  to  the  benefit  of  society through the combined efforts of its individual members. Academic Staff in particular should exercise their intellectual enquiry in a manner consonant with their right to free enquiry and with  their  membership  in  the  University  community.  A  full-time  academic  appointment entails  a  commitment  to  these  responsibilities.  The  University  is  committed  to  use  its resources so as to optimize the quality of work done by all of its academic staff members. It undertakes  to  develop,  with  thorough  consultation  and  careful  planning,  those  facilities, services and procedures which are conducive to excellence.

## 4. Integrity and Accountability

Professional integrity at The UWI  is based  on  respect for individual achievement. particularly within the academic culture.  As such, every staff member must recognize that he or she belongs to a community of scholars where academic integrity is a fundamental commitment.    The  University  as  an  institution  makes  collaboration  and  the  pursuit  of knowledge possible, but always promotes and evaluates individual effort learning. It is the responsibility  of  every  member  of  staff  to  familiarize  himself  or  herself  with  the  various rules,  regulations,  and policies  within the  University, including relevant policies governing activities not directly addressed herein.

## Inherent Rights

## 1. Right of Association

All staff of The University of the West Indies have the right to decide to join or not to join an association or trade union of their choice.

## 2. Academic Freedom

Academic  freedom  is  fundamental  in  facilitating  teaching,  research  and  scholarship  and therefore is recognized and protected by the University. It facilitates freedom of intellectual thought; which consists of an open exchange of ideas, right to freedom of inquiry and to be able to freely criticize, support and/or challenge belief structures in society and participate in activities that involve freedom of intellectual thought. This right carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a responsible and ethical way.

The  University  supports  academic  freedom,  which  means  the  freedom  to  study,  teach, publish  and  debate,  independent  of  current  opinion,  subject  to  commonly  accepted scholarly  standards.  The  right  to  academic  freedom  carries  with  it  the  duty  to  use  that freedom in a responsible and ethical way. Specifically, and without limiting the generality of the  above  academic  freedom  entitles  all  staff  members  to  freedom  in  carrying  out  their activities,  in  pursuing  research  and  scholarship    and  in  publishing  or  making  public  the results  thereof  and  freedom  from  institutional  censorship.  Academic  freedom  does  not require  neutrality  on  the  part  of  the  individual.  Academic  freedom  makes  commitment possible and carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base scholarly work and teaching on an honest search for knowledge. (See Annex 5 for articulation of the tenets of Academic Freedom)

## Engagements and Contribution to National Development and Global Discourses

- 1. OUTSIDE WORK/CONSULTANCIES/BUSINESS INTERESTS/DIRECTORSHIPS/RELATED CONFLICTS OF INTEREST (THIS SECTION IS APPLICABLE TO ACADEMIC, SENIOR PROFESSIONAL AND PROFESSIONAL STAFF ONLY)
- It is well-known  and  generally  accepted  that  extra-University  involvement  has  certain positive  characteristics  and  can  play  an  important  role  in  the  life  of  the  University.  For instance, it can:-
- (a) Promote interaction between the University and the non- University world to the benefit of both;
- (b) Facilitate the placing of students in temporary or permanent employment; aid in the discovery of research and thesis problems;
- (c) Contribute  to  the  professional  development  of  a  staff  member  through  the acquisition of new skills and techniques.
- (d) Provide  additional  opportunities  for  the  staff  member  to  apply  knowledge  to practical situations.

Such activities, which may or may not involve financial remuneration, are hereinafter called consulting and may include:

- (a) The  giving  of  professional  advice  in  areas  of  the  staff  member's  expertise  to clients whether in personal matters, industry or government;
- (b) Lecturing to public or private groups;
- (c) Services  related  to  publishing,  journalism,  broadcasting,  artistic  performances and other similar creative activities.

In  order  that  a  staff  member  may  properly  fulfill  responsibilities  to  the  University,  in  the areas  of  teaching,  research,  administration  and  other  areas  of  service,  such  activities beyond normal commitments should not be excessive.  The distraction of non-University occupations, the expenditure of emotional energies, the obligations contingent on accepting external fees and salaries may all interfere in the proper discharge of the primary University duties. (See also Annex 1.)

The  regulations  on  Consultancies  attached  as 'Work  Outside  the  University/Consultancy' Appendix 1, are concerned with establishing the appropriate level of outside service, so that a staff member's direct service to the University through teaching, research, administration and  other  services    is  assured,  while  the  contributions  made  through  consulting  are adequately  recognized. (See  also  Annex  3  for  an  articulation  of  the  various  types  of business interests.)

## 2. The University Staff Member and Political Activity

Direct political involvement is a matter for the individual. A university teacher who engages in  direct  political  activity  should  do  so  in  a  manner  compatible  with  his  or  her  academic profession and within the legal framework  of a duly constituted government.  All governments that contribute to the revenue of the University are expected both to preserve the legitimate freedom of the individual and to guarantee the right of individual expression outside of the University context.

The  University  as  a  developing  community  inevitably  becomes  involved  in  the  many problems of the community, and members of Staff are expected to bring their professional skills and talents to bear on these problems.

Members of Staff should not use the privilege of their institutional affiliations for partisan or personal ends where they engage in public affairs, e.g., in writing to or for the press they should not seek to identify their personal point of the view with that of the University.

The University cannot guarantee support for any of its members for consequences which flow from their political activity. In this respect, the individual teacher or researcher who accepts a personal role of political activity accepts as well a personal responsibility. Above all, the University cannot offer support for any advocate of violence.

The prime loyalty of University Staff member is to their profession and University. Members of Staff of the University of the West Indies are free to seek political and public office within the rules of the University in force at any particular time.

In  exercising  this  right  they  are  expected  to  use  their  discretion  and  to  consider  their academic  reputation  and  academic  affiliation.  University  employees  should  not  accept public office unless they are satisfied that such acceptance would not place them in conflict with  the  University.  While  holding  public  office,  the  University  Staff  members  should exercise  their  discretion  in  using  information  gained  within  the  University  in  the  political field, so as not to abuse any confidences. They should not condone attacks on the University or on their colleagues. .

## ETHICAL BEHAVIOUR/RESEARCH

- 1. Research  in  the  University  is  relevant  for  the  general  benefits  of  society,  as  well  as  for specific intellectual purposes. It should be used to increase knowledge in ways that do not harm society.
- 2. The University recognizes that research flourishes only in a climate of academic freedom. Since the conditions for good research in our many disciplines are quite different, individual investigators  are  normally  expected  to  assume  direct  responsibility  for  the  intellectual quality  of  their  work.  A  serious  responsibility  rests  on  the  individual  members  of  the academic  and  in  some  instances  the  professional  community  who  are  best  equipped through special knowledge to remain aware of the consequences of their research activity; the researcher must balance the possibility of harmful application against potential benefits.
- 3. The University for its part should ensure that the welfare of human subjects who participate in  research  carried  out  by  staff  and  students  is  safeguarded.  The  conscience  of  each investigator  in  applying  ethical  principles  is  the  single  most  important  protection  for  the welfare  of  human  subjects.  Such  principles  include  privacy,  confidentiality  of  research information, the right of subjects to information about experimental procedures, respect for subjects'  psychological  well-being  and  respect  for  social  stability  and  the  right  to  the protection  of  personal  data.  The  University  must  ensure  that  each  investigator's  ethical decisions  have  been  confirmed  or  modified  by  the  informed  and  dispassionate  advice  of peers who are not directly involved in the research. (Refer to policy on Research Ethics and The University Policy on Student Involvement in Research attached at Annex 3 ; the Policy on the Protection of  Personal Data and the Guidelines on Human and  Animal Subjects in Research  which are incorporated by reference in this Code )

## CONFIDENTIALITY

- 1. It is essential that staff members feel confident that information relating to them is treated in  a  highly  confidential  manner  with  due  attention  being  paid  to  the  right  to  privacy  of personal data as articulated in the relevant University Policies and the laws of the various UWI  jurisdictions  and  partner  institutions;  need  for  non-disclosure  of  confidential  and personal information.  File contents outside normal University business transactions.
- 2. Staff must take care to respect the confidentiality and privacy of students and personal data and only provide information in accordance with the University's policies and procedures and legislative requirements in relation to  privacy and data protection  or otherwise when authorized  by  the  Registrar's  Office..  Members  of  staff  are  expected  to  maintain  the integrity, confidentiality and privacy of such information to protect any individual concerned. The privacy of oral communication must also be maintained by staff members.
- 3. Academic  staff  members  who  have  access  to  University  information  and  documentation must  ensure  that  the  safety,  confidentiality,  integrity  and  privacy  of  the  information  is maintained, this also includes oral communication. It is important to note that the records of staff members are extremely confidential and must be treated in a manner so that staff members feel confident in relating their information in an appropriate manner.
- 4. The  University,  however,  will  encounter  legal  situations  where  the  well-being  of  its employees and students will take precedence over the desire for confidentiality.

## INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

The  University  policy  on  Intellectual  Property  is  hereby  incorporated  by  reference  into  this Statement. (See The University of The West Indies Policy on Intellectual Property.)

## INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

The University of the West Indies places an emphasis on the fact that staff must keep in mind the core values of the University when accessing the internet; through sending and receiving email,  use  of  social  media  networks,.    Improper  use  of  information  technology  whether  by: accessing or disseminating offensive material via the internet or email against regulations will be considered an infringement of University policy and disciplinary action may apply to  staff who  are  found  in  breach  of  the  policies. (See  Acceptable  Use  Policy,  Information  AND Communication Technology/ See also Information Security Policy which are incorporated by reference in this policy)

## RELATIONSHIPS IN THE WORKPLACE

## 1. General Principles of Ethical Behavior and Good Relationships

The  University, in seeking to achieve its mission, further its goals and  realize its commitments  to  intellectual  enquiry,  the  provision  of  instruction  and  supervision  to  all registered students, and the maintenance of high standards in all its pursuits, aims to create an environment of tolerance and respect, believing that the right of individuals to advance their views openly must be upheld throughout the University.

Realization of these intentions requires respect for the following general principles:-

- (a) That each member of the University endeavors to contribute to the existence of a just and  supportive  community  based  on  equality  and  respect  for  individual differences.
- (b) That  no  member  of  the  University  community  (academic,  administrative,  nonacademic  staff,  student)  should  unduly  interfere  with  the  study,  work  or  working environment  of  other  members  of  the  University.  This  shall  be  taken  to  apply  to both Campus-based activities and official off-Campus activities and functions, such as programs and course-related field trips.
- (c) That    those    with    academic    or      employment    supervisory  authority  use  such authority,  both  on  Campus  and  off,  solely  for  the  purposes  explicitly  stated  or implied in University policies and regulations and with regard to the overall  aims and purposes of the University.

Relationships  of  a  personal  nature  which  may  involve  staff,  students  or  members  of  the community  in  the  University  environment  should  not  interfere  with,  or  be  perceived  to interfere with or influence University policies and  customs in the workplace. The University of The West Indies expects all staff to avoid conflict due to personal relationships which can include:

- (a) Emotional relationships (including sexual relationships and friendships)
- (b) Family  relationships  (including spouse,  children,  siblings, cousins,  relations by marriage, parents or other close relatives)
- (c) Financial relationships (including commercial relationships where pecuniary interest is present)

## 2. Staff-Student Relationships

The  staff-student  relationship  is  a  special  one,  involving  some  measure  of  confidence between the parties. Partly owing to this confidence and partly to the risk of misrepresentation  where  statements  are  quoted  out  of  context,  neither  party  should publish  outside  the  classroom  opinions  expressed  by  the  other  therein,  without  first obtaining the permission of the other. The teacher, in his or her capacity as a teacher, has the right and duty to encourage the pursuit of learning and to stimulate profound inquiry among his or her students, but whilst reserving his or her rightful exercise of free speech as a  citizen,  he  should  not  appear  to  choose  dogmatically  between  conflicting  policies  or ideologies. The  line is a difficult one  to  draw  and  will  often  involve  questions  of temperament and judgment and will often call for self-restraint.

The  special  relationship  should  not  be  used  by  a  teacher  for  the  purpose  of  religious, political,  or  racial  propaganda.  The  staff-student  relationship  is  also  one  of  inequality,  in which the   member of the staff usually possesses the advantage. Staff should therefore be scrupulous not to exploit the relationship to their advantage and in their published work should  make  appropriate  acknowledgement  of  any  assistance  they  have  received  from students. All students are entitled to equality of opportunity and nothing should be done to favor a student or group of students above others.

Members of staff should respect the right of student organisation to autonomy and should not attempt to manipulate the policy of such organisations.

Members of staff should not condone or encourage violation of rules made in respect of the student community.

## 3. Relationship  of  Colleagues  in  the  Academic  Community  (this  Section  applies  to  all Academic Staff)

It is a duty of university teachers to do research and to present their material in scholarly ways. It is recognized that criticism is legitimate within the academic community, but care must be exercised in the way criticisms are expressed. Criticisms of colleagues should be restricted to relevant scholarly and academic matters, and should always be made in a spirit of mutual respect.

Senior members of staff are required, from time to time, to assist in administrative duties, such as service on Academic Boards and Committees of the University, and as Departmental Heads  or  Faculty  Deans.  The  participation  of  the  junior  staff  members  in  administrative duties  should  be  kept  to  a  minimum  so  as  to  allow  them  every  opportunity  to  establish themselves as teachers and researchers.

## 4. Relationship between Other Members of Staff

Relationships  of  a  personal  nature  must  not  interfere  with  the  following  processes  or decisions:

- (a) Assessment of students
- (b) Authorization of payments
- (c) Confirmation of appointment
- (d) Performance review
- (e) Selection and promotion of staff
- (f) Selection of students for admission
- (g) Staff development opportunities

If a staff member has become involved in a relationship of a personal nature with a student who  is  in  any  manner  under  the  Staff  member's  tutelage,  this  relationship  should  be

declared to the Campus Registrar or the University Registrar as the case may be as it may be a source of conflict.

## 5. Relationship of Staff Members to the General Extra-University Community

The  University  staff  member  has  an  important  role  to  play  in  the  development  of  the community.  Academic, Senior professional  and  Administrative  Staff  and  persons  in  other supervisory  positions  have  special  responsibilities  to  the  achievement  the  University's strategic  goals.  The  University  staff  member  also  makes  important  contributions  to  the development of the society in which they live by performing their duties fully and well .

Recognizing  that  professional  commitment  often  takes  members  of  staff  into  the  extrauniversity  community,  the  University  consequently  takes  into  the  account  the  quality  of their public activity and contribution to the community in assessing their performance and their claims for advancement.

## INTEGRITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY

## 1. Conflict of Interest

The  University  acknowledges  a  commitment,  as  part  of  its  overall  mission,  to  transfer knowledge,  discoveries  and  technology  to  society  for  its  benefit.  Interaction  of  staff members  of  the  University  with  external  entities  is  desirable  and  encouraged  when  the activity  is  beneficial  to  the  professional  standing  of  the  individual,  the  reputation  of  the University,  or  provides  a  community  or  professional  service.  Whatever  the  nature  of  the external activities or relationships, the University expects each of its members - academic and senior administrative staff, students and other officers - to act in a manner consistent with  a  high  standard  of  integrity  and  ethical  behavior.  Accordingly,  the  University  of  the West Indies obligates its staff, members and officers acting on its behalf to avoid ethical, legal,  financial  or  other  conflicts  of  interest  which  may  impede  or  compromise  their University responsibilities or the mission of the institution.

A conflict of interest or a perceived or potential conflict exists when a member of staff of the University is or may be in a position to use, research, knowledge, authority or influence for  personal  or  family  gain  or  to  benefit  others  to  the  detriment  of  the  University.  Staff members are guided by the Guidelines in Annex2 and the University's Financial Code.

A fundamental tenet is that staff members should, of their own volition, takes the initiative in  disclosing conflicts or potential conflicts of interest situations. The mere existence of a conflict or a potential conflict does not necessarily imply that the activity concerned should cease.  Accordingly,  any  member  or  staff  of  the  University  community  with  a  conflict  or potential conflict should seek the counsel and advice of his or her immediate supervisor and may disclose the details to that individual. A disclosure form is available for this purpose. ( Further guidelines on conflicts of interest are in Annex 2.)

## 2. Procurement

It  is  the  responsibility  of  every  staff  member  of  the  University  involved  in  the  supply  of goods or services, to or for the University, to declare in writing all relevant interest that the

staff  member  may  have  in  any  proposed  transaction.  In  particular,  those  staff  members who deal directly with suppliers must:

- (a) Ensure that their processes are open and transparent;
- (b) Not engage in misleading or deceptive conduct;
- (c) Not transact with suppliers for private or unauthorized use; and
- (d) Not  compromise  the  University's  standing  or  integrity  of  its  purchasing  activities through the acceptance of gifts or hospitality.

Staff members, contractors and their employees and any other category of person to whom this  Code  applies  must  have  regard  to  the  University's  procurement  Rules,  The  Financial Code and the Financial Procedures existing from time to time.

## 3. Gifts

Staff  members  should  not  solicit,  encourage  or  accept  gifts  or  benefits  if  it  could  be reasonably seen as an inducement to act in a particular way, or to place a  staff member under an obligation that may either directly or indirectly compromise or influence them in their official capacity.

In  particular,  University  employees  should  indicate  to  the  prospective  givers  that  gifts cannot  be  accepted  from  those  with  whom  the  University  has,  or  potentially  has, commercial dealings. Staff members who receive small gifts or tokens of appreciation may retain those items as personal property or donate them to the University. Notwithstanding these  provisions,  staff  members  who  are  in  doubt  as  to  the  category  of  gifts  being presented  should  consult  with  their  supervisors,  the  Campus  Registrar  or  the  University Registrar as the case may be.

As  a  general  guide,  Heads  of  departments  and  units  may  authorize  expenditure  on  floral tributes, small gifts and other tokens of appreciation in the event of the death or serious illness  of  a  staff  member  or  person  with  an  identifiable  relationship  with  the  University,

work-related  special  occasions  such  as  an  important  official  visit  or  guest  speaker  at  the University or the retirement of a long serving member of University staff.

All members of staff must at times comply with the provisions of the Financial Code and the Financial Procedures.

## CONSULTANCY RULES

The Consultancy rules are as follows:

For the purposes of these regulations, consulting by a staff member shall include all activities that are conducted on behalf of persons or bodies outside the University that fall into the area of  competence  related to  the  staff  member's  regular  academic  duties  in  the  University,  and that are not part of grants or agreements between the University  and outside persons or bodies.

## Substantial Consulting

For the purposes of these regulations, the term substantial consulting refers to consulting that is so extensive as to suggest the possibility of interference with the performance of the staff  member's  normal  academic  duties.  Without  limiting  the  above,  consulting  activities  in excess of one day a week shall be considered as substantial.

It is the responsibility of staff members to initiate discussions with their Heads/Deans as   to whether their consulting activities are substantial.

Staff members are required to inform their Heads/Deans in writing of any consultancy which they intend to undertake, its duration and their arrangements to ensure that their University work obligations are dutifully and diligently carried out. Staff members shall not compete, in their personal capacity, with the University for Consultancies. Staff shall not undertake substantial consulting without the written approval of their Head of Department or Deans. In cases  where  the  Head  of  Department  or  Dean  so  requests,  for  professional  reasons,  the approving authority may be the campus Principal. The relationship of the work proposed to the staff  member's  area  of  specialization,  and  to  their  academic  duties,  shall  be  important considerations in the approval process.

## Leave of absence

If consulting involves repeated absences from the University for sustained periods of time so as to interfere with the performance of the staff member's academic duties, the staff members shall  be  expected  to  apply  for  a  leave  of  absence,  a  reduced  work  load  or  part  time appointment.

## Use of University Facilities

Staff members shall obtain prior approval of any consulting commitment that will involve more than an inconsequential use of university facilities, supplies and other services, include those rendered by the support staff, without making appropriate financial arrangements in advance.

## Payment into Departmental Account

Members of staff shall pay by August 1st of each year, not less than 15% of the net earnings made in the previous twelve months, together with an appropriate payment, where applicable, to  the  fund  or  relevant  departmental  account  for  the  use  of  the  Faculty's  or  Department's equipment, materials and services. A member of staff is free to make additional contributions to the fund on a voluntary basis. The cost of administering the fund shall be borne by the fund.

## Disbursements from the Fund

Every  full-time  member  of  the  Faculty  may  apply  for  a  disbursement  from  the  Consultation Fund, whether or not that member of staff has made any contribution to the Fund. Members of staff will be allowed to withdraw sums from the Fund in accordance with the approved Faculty rules.

Normally the Funds are used for the following purposes:-

- (a) Travelling to conferences and other research activities
- (b)  Payment of journals of learned societies provided that such journals become the property of the University
- (c)   Payment of membership fees to professional societies, provided that the particular membership is in the best interest of the Department
- (d)  Reasonable travel in connection with consultations
- (e) Professional insurance for members of the University staff
- (f)  Honoraria for special services in connection with research.

## Reporting obligations

Staff members shall report annually on their consulting activities shall set forth the time spent, the  distribution  of  the  consulting  activities  through  the  year,  the  nature  of  the  work,  the allocation  of  time  between  the  public  and  private  sectors,  and  the  identity  of  the  clients. However, the names of clients or sponsors in situations where established professional secrecy or discretion normally prevail will not be reported.

The reports shall also include other information such as details on frequent travel, ethical issues and periods of intense activity which may have affected the Staff member's academic duties,

which may be relevant to an evaluation as to whether the consulting has been of overall benefit to  the  University.  In  addition,  the  individual  Faculties  may,  by  resolution  of  Faculty  Boards, require additional information.

The Dean/Head of the University should be responsible for monitoring these reports and for reporting to F&amp;GPC on consultancies undertaken by members of Staff.

The report submitted by the Staff members shall be summarized in suitable form in the Annual Reports of Departments or Faculties. If the Staff members wish to include information on their consulting activities in their dossiers for consideration of tenure or promotion the full reports submitted to the Deans shall be made available.

## Further Guidelines

When consulting, staff members shall not purport to represent the University unless expressly authorized to do so by their Deans.

Staff  members  shall  not  use  University  stationery  for  consulting  purposes  without  written approval of their Deans.

Except for occasional lectures, seminars of scholar presentations, Staff members shall not teach at other institutions without the prior written approval of their Deans.

Notwithstanding  the  definition  of  consulting  in  clause  38  the  present  regulations  shall  be applicable in matters of copyright. Where members of the academic Staff spend a substantial amount  of  time  on  activities  related  to  the  preparation  of  copyright  items  such  as  books, records, film or software items not directly related to the performance of their academic duties, they are expected to make full disclosure of these activities to  their Head of Departments A 'substantial amount of time' shall be determined by the   definition of 'substantial consulting'.

Consulting  and  other  clinical  activities  undertaken  by  full-time  members  of  the  Faculties  of Medical Sciences shall be governed by the regulations and procedures of the Faculty of Medical Sciences and its teaching hospitals. Special arrangements for consulting may be made for other professional Facilities with the approval of Council.

## ANNEX 2

## CONFLICT OF INTEREST

- 1. Conflict of interest arises where the nexus between a personal interest and a professional obligation is such that could result in a reasonable belief or active fact that that the personal interest may influence the exercise of professional responsibilities.
- (a) An actual  conflict involves  a  direct  conflict  between  a  staff  member's  duties  and responsibilities  to  the  University  and  a  competing  interest  or  obligation,  whether personal or involving a third party.
- (b) A perceived  conflict exists  where  it  could  reasonably  be  perceived,  or  give  the appearance, that a competing interest could improperly influence the performance of a staff member's duties and responsibilities to the University.
- (c) A potential  conflict  of  interest arises  where  a  staff  member  has  an  interest  or obligation, whether personal or involving a third party, that could conflict with the staff member's duties and responsibilities to the University.
- (d) Pecuniary interest involves an actual or potential financial gain or loss.  It may, for example, result from the staff member owning property, holding shares or a position in a company bidding for University work, accepting gifts or hospitality or receiving an income from a second job.
- (e) Non-pecuniary  interest does  not  involve  a  financial  component  but  may,  for example, arise from personal or family relationship or involvement in sporting, social or  cultural  activities.   It  includes  any  favour  or  prejudice  resulting  from  friendship, animosity or other personal involvement that could lead to bias in the exercise of judgment or a discretion or the making of a decision.
- 2. The University's Code of Conduct requires staff members to avoid conflicts of interest (including perceived conflicts) and where conflicts of interest do arise, to manage those conflicts appropriately in accordance with this Policy.
- 3. Without limiting the obligations set out in this Policy, staff are expected to:
- (a) Restrict  the  extent  to  which  a  private  interest  could  compromise,  or  be  seen  to compromise, their impartiality when carrying out their official duties.

- (b) Abstain from involvement in official decisions and actions which could be compromised by other private interests and affiliations.
- (c) Avoid  private  action  in  which  they  could  be  seen  to  have  an  improper  advantage from confidential/privileged information they might have access to because of their official duties.
- (d) Not use their official position or university resources for private personal gain or gain by others with whom the staff member has a relationship or personal association.
- (e) Ensure that there can be no perception that they have received an improper benefit that may influence the performance of their official duties; and not take improper advantage of their official position or confidential/privileged information gained in that  position  when  seeking  employment  outside  The  University,  or  provide  such advantage to others with whom they have an association.

## Identifying a Conflict of Interest

- 1. Staff members must assess their private and personal interests and identify whether they conflict or have the potential to conflict with their official duties.
- 2. A conflict of interest may include circumstances involving:
- (a) A conflict between the staff member's obligations to the University and a competing interest, including conflicts between the duties to the University and obligations to other organisations.
- (b) Favoring a personal financial interest over a duty to the University.
- (c) Decisions based on personal relationships rather than the duty to act impartially; or decisions based on the receipt of personal benefits.
- 3. The following table sets out a few examples of potential, perceived and actual conflicts of interest.

| Private interest/                                                                     | Potential conflict of interest                       | Perceived conflict of interest                            | Actual conflict of interest    |

- 4. When considering whether a conflict of interest exists, a staff member should consider:
- (a) Whether  the  action  or  activity  is  consistent  with  the  principles  outlined  in  the University's Code of Conduct.
- (b) Whether the action or activity is consistent with The  UWI community values, standards and behaviours.
- (c) How  the  action  might  be  viewed  or  perceived  by  other  people;  and  whether  the relationship  or  interest  might  compromise  an  individual's  ability  to  exercise  sound leadership or judgment.

## Specific Obligations

## Conflict of roles

Where individuals  have  more  than  one  official  role  at  the  University  or  an  official  role  in  a different  organisation,  it  may  be  difficult  to  keep  their  roles  separate.  The  University's Work Outside/Consultancy rule (Annex 1)  policy requires staff members to declare any conflicts of

interest (including potential conflicts of interest) to their Head of the Faculty, Institute, School, Centre or Division. Company directors and officers have particularly onerous obligations under the respective Companies' Acts which may affect a staff member's ability to fulfil their duties to the  University.   For  this  reason,  the  University's Work  Outside/Consultancy  rule  (Annex  1) staff policy requires staff members to obtain the prior written approval of the Principal or ViceChancellor before accepting a position as a director, secretary, public officer or executive officer of any company, whether or not the position is paid.

## Private interests

A conflict of interest may be pecuniary or non-pecuniary and can arise from avoiding personal losses as well as gaining personal advantage.

## Personal relationships

Staff  members  should  not  be  involved  in  decisions  affecting  the  employment  or  academic administration of  a  person  with  whom  the  staff  member  has  a  current  or  previous  personal relationship.  The  University's  Statement  of  Ethical  Principles  and   Code  of  Conduct requires staff members to notify their supervisor of any relevant conflict of interest or potential conflict of  interest  arising  from  a  current  or  previous  personal  relationship  and  cease  any  decision making role in respect of the relevant student or staff member pending further direction from their supervisor.

## Personal benefits

A conflict of interest may occur where a staff member receives a benefit which is, or may be perceived as, an incentive or inducement to perform or not to perform an official function or duty.

## Managing a Conflict of Interest

Effective management of conflicts of interest depends on the joint participation of staff, supervisors and the University.  All conflicts of interest must be managed transparently.

## Staff

- 1. Without limiting the specific obligations outlined above, where a staff member has a conflict of interest or a potential conflict of interest, the staff member should:
- 2. Declare the conflict of interest by:

## ANNEX 3

## BUSINESS INTERESTS

- (1.) Business  Interests  are  defined  as  a  company  directorship  and/or  other  business involvement resulting from a Staff member's professional work, qualification, shareholding,  proprietary  or  other  personal  interest,  including  University  spin-offs;  or other position of influence with a business or company, but excluding private companies whose sole purpose is to act as trustee for a family trust.

## Related conflicts of interests

- (1.) A staff member must avoid situations where there is or may reasonably be perceived to be  a  conflict  of  interest  in  undertaking  any  outside  work  or  business  interest.   A situation of conflict, or potential conflict of interest, arises where a staff member is in, or is seen to be in, a position to influence a decision of the University that may favour the staff member personally, associates of the staff member, or some other business interest  or  activity  of  the  staff  member.  Conflicts  of  interest  may  arise  between  a person's role as a staff member and the duties as a company director. Staff members who have a position of influence in a business that may provide goods or services to the University  must  declare  their  interest,  in  writing,  to  their  Head  of  School,  Director  of Division or Centre. In particular, an interest or a relationship with a business must be disclosed before a decision is made by the University to order goods or services, or to undertake  other  financial  or  contractual  obligations.  A  staff  member  in  this  situation must not be involved in such a decision.
- (2.) Staff members  must  also  declare  their  interest  in  situations  of  potential  conflict  of interest. A potential conflict is created in the case of a staff member being in a position of influence with a business, which is dealing with the same type of goods or services as that area of the University in which the staff member is employed. It could also occur with the conduct of research where the outcomes could influence market expectations about financial results of a company in which the staff member has an interest. Where there is some cause for concern regarding a conflict, this must be discussed with the supervisor, or the University Registrar or Campus Registrar as the case may be. Head of the organizational unit and must be noted on the application for approval.

- (3.) Whilst  Independent  Contactors  do  not  derive  any  benefits  from  their  contracts  of engagements,  in  some  instances  their  contracts  require  that  they  do  not  engage  in activities that conflict with their terms of reference defined pursuant to their contracts with The University. Independent Contracts are expected to disclose any activity that may appear or prove to be conflicting with their work with the University.

## ANNEX 4

## POLICY ON STUDENT INVOLVEMENT IN RESEARCH

The  following  policy  relates  specifically  to  undergraduate  and  graduate  students  who  are engaged in research as  part  of  their  university  programs.  Some  sections  also  apply  to  those cases  where  an  investigator  enlists  the  services  of  an  inexperienced  person  as  assistant, technician, trainee, etc. in connection with a research project.

## Health and Safety

- (1.) It  is  the  responsibility  of  the  investigator to  implement all possible measures that will ensure the health and safety of his/her research colleagues. Such measures include:
- a) Strict  adherence  to  the  safety  procedures  set  forth  in  any  regulations  of  the building in which the research is being carried out.
- b) Careful  training  of  all  new  personnel  in  the  correct  usage  of  equipment  and materials.
- c) Provision  of  adequate  protective  clothing;  first  aid  kits,  etc.  and  their  regular inspection.
- d) Clear precautionary labeling of containers of hazardous materials.
- (2.) Students, especially undergraduates, tend to have only temporary involvement with a research project and may be absent during routine safety drills. Particularly, attention should  be  given  to  the  instruction  of  each  beginning  student.  Solitary  work  in laboratories  containing  potential  hazards  should  be  strongly  discouraged.    Research projects shall avoid a requirement for solitary after-hours work.
- (3.) Where  research  projects  involve  the  use  of especially hazardous  materials  (e.g. radioactive, carcinogenic or poisonous  chemicals)  departments  shall ensure  that students have signed a statement that they have received and read appropriate health and safety information.

## Academic considerations

- (1.) When  a  student  assists  in  a  research  project,  a  clear  distinction  should  be  made between work for which the student is paid, and research training which contributes to the student's academic program.

- (2.) As  a  general  rule,  paid  work  should  not  be  considered  eligible  for  credit  towards  an Undergraduate course. In some departments, different arrangements have traditionally been held; in such departments open discussion should ensure that one policy is applied uniformly throughout the department and disseminated to students.
- (3.) When a graduate student is assigned a salary or partial support by the investigator (e.g. from  an  operating  grant  or  similar  fund  controlled  by the  investigator)  a clear agreement should be made as to the duties expected or the student in conjunction with the investigator's own research project vis-a-vis the work contributing to the student's thesis.

## Secrecy

When a student begins working with an investigator who may be funded in whole or in part by contracts, consulting agreements or grants from outside agencies, a clear agreement should be made at the outset as to the accessibility of research findings for publication.

## Responsibilities of the Student

Academic freedom brings responsibilities to  students  and  staff  alike.  Students  should  realize that the good name and research reputation of the University and its professors rests in large measure upon the quality of research done by its students.

## Responsibilities of the University

- (1.) The  University shall inform students of all appropriate regulations and  policies concerning research.
- (2.) The University shall provide a safe research environment for student researchers.

## ANNEX 5

## Academic Freedom

## PART 1: What it does do

Academic freedom means that both faculty members and students can engage in intellectual debate without fear of censorship or retaliation.

Academic freedom establishes a faculty member's right to remain true to his or her pedagogical philosophy  and  intellectual commitments.  It  preserves  the intellectual integrity of our educational system and thus serves the public good.

Academic  freedom  in  teaching  means  that  both  faculty  members  and  students  can  make comparisons  and  contrasts  between  subjects  taught  in  a  course  and  any  field  of  human knowledge or period of history.

Academic freedom gives both students and faculty the right to express their views - in speech, writing,  and  through  electronic  communication,  both  on  and  off  campus  -  without  fear  of sanction, unless the manner of expression substantially impairs the rights of others or, in the case  of  faculty  members,  those  views  demonstrate  that  they  are  professionally  ignorant, incompetent, or dishonest with regard to their discipline or fields of expertise.

Academic freedom gives both students and faculty the right to study and do research on the topics  they  choose  and  to  draw  what  conclusions  they  find  consistent  with  their  research, though  it  does  not  prevent  others  from  judging  whether  their  work  is  valuable  and  their conclusions  sound.  To  protect  academic  freedom,  universities  should  oppose  efforts  by corporate or government sponsors to block dissemination of any research findings.

Academic  freedom  means  that  the  political,  religious,  or  philosophical  beliefs  of  politicians, administrators, and members of the public cannot be imposed on students or faculty.

Academic freedom gives faculty members and students the right to seek redress or request a hearing if they believe their rights have been violated.

Academic freedom protects faculty members and students from reprisals for disagreeing with administrative policies or proposals.

Academic freedom gives faculty members and students the right to challenge one another's views, but not to penalize them for holding them.

Academic freedom protects a faculty member's authority to assign grades to students, so long as  the  grades  are  not  capricious  or  unjustly  punitive.  More  broadly,  academic  freedom encompasses both the individual and institutional right to maintain academic standards.

Academic  freedom  gives  faculty  members  substantial  latitude  in  deciding  how  to  teach  the courses for which they are responsible.

Academic  freedom  guarantees  that  serious  charges  against  a  faculty  member  will  be  heard before a committee of his or her peers. It provides faculty members the right to due process, including  the  assumption  that  the burden  of  proof  lies  with  those  who  brought  the  charges, that  faculty  have  the  right  to  present  counter-evidence  and  confront  their  accusers,  and  be assisted by an attorney in serious cases if they choose.

## PART 2: What It Doesn't Do

Academic freedom does not mean a faculty member can harass, threaten, intimidate, ridicule, or impose his or her views on students.

Student  academic  freedom  does  not  deny  faculty  members  the  right  to  require  students  to master course material and the fundamentals of the disciplines that faculty teach.

Neither academic freedom nor tenure protects an incompetent teacher from losing his or her job. Academic freedom thus does not grant an unqualified guarantee of lifetime employment.

Academic freedom does not protect faculty members from colleague or student challenges to or disagreement with their educational philosophy and practices.

Academic  freedom  does  not  protect  faculty  members  from  non-university  penalties  if  they break the law.

Academic freedom does not give students or faculty the right to ignore college or university regulations,  though  it  does  give  faculty  and  students  the  right  to  criticize  regulations  they believe are unfair.

Academic freedom does not protect students or faculty from disciplinary action,  but  it  does require that they receive fair treatment and due process.

Academic  freedom  does  not  protect faculty members  from  sanctions  for  professional misconduct, though sanctions require clear proof established through due process.

Academic freedom does not protect a faculty member from investigations into allegations of scientific misconduct or violations of sound university policies, nor from appropriate penalties should such charges be sustained in a hearing of record before an elected faculty body.
