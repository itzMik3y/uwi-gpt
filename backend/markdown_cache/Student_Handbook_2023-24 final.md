## MESSAGE FROM THE VICE-CHANCELLOR

<!-- image -->

## Welcome to The University of the West Indies!

As you enter the portals of this august institution, I wish you the very best for academic success and personal growth.  Form and foster friendships, they will keep you focused throughout your programs and last into your professional lives. Take full advantage of the co-curricular opportunities available.  Be attentive to your physical and mental health and I ask you to be considerate of others - be the embodiment of the beautiful quote from Archbishop Desmond Tutu ' My humanity is bound up in yours, for we can only be human together .'

Each year, our new students inspire enthusiasm and hope for the entire community. Your enthusiasm, activism and full engagement will ensure that we - us and you - stay the course. Your responsibility will be to ensure that the resources dedicated to your training are maximised as much as possible. However your education is funded - by your Governments, your families or yourselves, or by philanthropic donors, it is an investment in your future, in our collective future.  Your University is committed to ensuring that we deliver programmes of high quality and relevance to national and regional development, in as safe an environment as possible.

The pivot to the virtual environment during the COVID-19 pandemic provided us with opportunities to review and renew how we do many things. Blended learning is now mainstream rather than occasional. However, all our campuses have largely reverted to face-toface learning with options for online where necessary. I encourage you to engage in vigorous academic debates and take full advantage of the leadership opportunities that are provided through the co-curricular activities. Your university is an activist university, with a responsibility to participate in debate around the issues threatening the region it serves, and also to find and implement solutions. The UWI has a proud tradition of preparing leaders for our region and beyond in every discipline and at every level of operation. We are counting on you to keep the 'light rising from the West.'

In 2021 The UWI was ranked by the Times Higher Education among the best 1.5% of universities in the world. This achievement was based on our successful implementation of our Triple 'A' Strategic Plan 2017-2022. The three pillars of Access, Agility and Alignment: increasing access to our courses and programmes as well as to our technical expertise, demonstrating agility in our response to challenges such as the pandemic, and alignment with strategic partners including our Governments to meet their specific needs, guided us in affirming The UWI's reputation at the global level.

The current phase of our strategic plan 2022-2027 will focus on generating revenue, on strengthening our global reach, and on infusing even more technology into our learning and other processes. It promises to be an exciting phase for us all and the team looks forward to sharing this journey with you.

Blessings!

Hilary Beckles Vice-Chancellor

## FROM PRO VICE-CHANCELLOR AND CAMPUS PRINCIPAL, GLOBAL CAMPUS

<!-- image -->

I warmly and heartily welcome you, our new and returning students, to The UWI Global Campus (formerly, The UWI Open Campus) during this important  period  in  our  history  where  we  stand  at  the  cusp  of  some momentous transformations, especially the rebranding and repositioning of  the  Open  Campus to the  Global  Campus,  approved by the University Council in November 2022. You are a noteworthy part of history  because  you  belong  to  the  first  cohort  of  Global  Campus students.

While you will hear a lot more about this exciting development in the coming weeks, I must tell you that this occasion also signifies, inter alia ,

that  you  are  a  part  of  a  profound  Regional  movement  and  you  belong  to  an  elite  institution which has taken the courageous step to launch into the Global domain. Our standing within the 1.5 per cent of the best universities and higher education intuitions in the world, as ranked by the prestigious Times Higher Education, was duly earned and we should all feel fittingly proud as Caribbean citizens.

You are  rightfully  at  the  core  of  this  evolving  movement,  in  which  we  fulfill  our  University's Triple  A  (Access,  Alignment,  Agility)  Mission  of  conveying  our  programmes  to  the  world, captured  thus: To  advance  learning,  create  knowledge  and  foster  innovation  for  the  positive transformation of the Caribbean and the wider world . The foregoing fits snugly within the Vision of An excellent Global University rooted in the Caribbean .

The COVID-19 Pandemic has taught us that higher education will never be the same again and that the future of higher education institutions are fundamentally dependent on their having the capacity  to  deliver  high  quality  qualifications  and  skills  at  all  levels  through  asynchronous online modality. The COVID-19 Pandemic disrupted your professional and personal lives and in fact  very  few  people,  if  any  at  all,  remained  untouched.  Many  universities  had  to  close  their doors  and,  as  a  result,  the  academic  lives  of  many  students  were  brought  to  a  grinding  halt. Fortunately, The University of the West Indies Open Campus, and The University of the West Indies in general, remained open and students were able to forge ahead in the pursuit of their hopes and aspirations.

In that regard, the Global Campus (formerly the Open Campus) has been a profound boon and blessing to the Caribbean and our students. We did not close our door to students for one day. The  COVID-19  Pandemic  provided  the  Campus  with  a  rare  opportunity  to  demonstrate  its supremacy  in  delivering  asynchronous  online  education  as  opposed  to  remote  emergency teaching. The Open Campus (now Global Campus) embraced the opportunity and was a beacon of asynchronous online education in the Caribbean Region. You would also be pleased to know that we were able to share this expertise through training, with our sister campuses, as well as other educational institutions throughout the Region.

The rebranding of the Open Campus as the Global Campus and its repositioning on the world stage,  represent  the  University's  vote  of  confidence  in  us.  The  foregoing  is  appropriately summarized in this extract from a UWI document which asserts, 'The UWI sees an opportunity to  leverage  its  global  academic  reputation  and the  online  education  capabilities  of  the  Open Campus [italics mine] to enter and serve selected niche areas of the large and rapidly expanding global  online  education  market.'  The  document  continues:  'The  development  of  the  Global Campus  aligns  with  a  broader  trend  in  higher  education  that  is  reimagining  how  tertiary education is delivered to suit the needs and learning preferences of students and learners in the online space.'

Within our Global Campus will be the International School of Development Justice (ISDJ) which will offer programmes in the academic spheres encompassing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, such as climate change, food security, public health, sport and culture, the international  economic order, poverty and underdevelopment in the post-colonial world, law and social  justice,  renewable  energy,  the environment,  tourism sustainability,  new diplomacy for  global  equality,  gender  justice,  and  reparations.  These  programmes,  which  will  originate from all our five campuses, will be offered fundamentally at the Master's level. I say this to whet your appetites and to bring you up to date with what is emerging, as you continue to plan your academic trajectories.

Students, you are therefore entering or returning to the Global Campus (previously the Open Campus)  at  an  exciting  time.  Some  of  you  are  already  proficient  at  and  au  fait  with asynchronous  online  technology  and  you  are  very  much  at  home  in  a  world  that  is  moving inexorably towards the Fourth Industrial Revolution or Industry 4.0, where we experience the natural world through the mediation or intercession of technology. For those who are uncertain and a little nervous about this new world and learning milieu, there is no need to fear as we have skilled staff along with the necessary tools that will reduce whatever technophobia you face. The good news is that, when you graduate, you will emerge with your academic credentials as well as full confidence in your ability to navigate the virtual world - our omnipresent reality in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. In essence, dear students, there are many exciting changes and innovations ahead as the Global Campus 'unfurls'. These changes will be communicated to you during the course of the academic year.

Earning high quality education from a top world class university today is hardly discretionary. It is almost obligatory and something you owe to yourselves. It is also never too late. Hence, to use a  familiar  yet  picturesque  expression  in  some  of  our  countries,  The  UWI  Global  Campus  is 'where it's at'. We are therefore delighted to have you on board as you take the online journey with us and pursue your respective areas of interest. My expectation is that every staff member in every department of the Campus feels responsible for your experience, notwithstanding that some are specifically charged with that role. I encourage you to read all the relevant resources that will be available and accessible to facilitate your journey so that you will be an enlightened customer, which also means that you know exactly who or where your first point of contact is when a particular matter arises. Being knowledgeable in that regard will minimize any delays and frustrations and is certainly superior to and yields better results than sending emails to a mass recipient group.

I also urge you to take full advantage of your excellent online library resources. We have welltrained  librarians  at  the  Campus  Libraries  and  Information  Services.  As  scholars,  you  would want to inquire about the Liaison Services (LS) and their provision of, inter alia, information literacy instruction; copyright and intellectual property; and scholarly communication/publication.  You  are  our  fundamental  customers,  and  your  experience  must always reflect this. This means that you must constantly feel that you can make queries or raise matters that might impact on your student experience, without anyone making you feel that you are  out  of  place  or  wrong  to  do  so.  My  hope  is  that  you  do  so  in  a  respectful  and  courteous manner.

As I ruminate over the foregoing, I feel compelled to encourage you to be civic-minded, and part of doing so is to participate in and support your student government. The Guild of Students has traditionally worked well with the Campus leaders to ensure that our students are afforded a learner ecology that mirrors the elite institution they attend. We thank former Guild of Students President Mrs Christine McCann and her team for their collaboration and generosity, and we welcome current President Mr Olson Browne to his new role and wish him and his team well.

On behalf of the leadership team of the Global Campus, I extend my best wishes to you for a productive, pleasing, and enjoyable academic year of new knowledge and discoveries, and all the discipline which logically accompanies the foregoing.

Francis O. Severin, PhD Pro Vice-Chancellor and Campus Principal

Althea Gordon Campus Registrar

## MESSAGE FROM GUILD PRESIDENT, GLOBAL CAMPUS

<!-- image -->

I  extend  greetings to our new Pelicans on behalf of the Global Campus  Guild  of  Students.  Welcome  to  The  University  of  the West  Indies  family,  and  congratulations  on  your  decision  to further  your  education  at  this  prestige  institution  which  is  in the  elite  band  of  the  top  five  percent  (5%)  of  universities worldwide. I further welcome our returning Pelicans to the new academic year of 2023-2024, which will bring new experiences, challenges, and successes.

Our values emphasize the importance of student development and success in all that we do. We value the ability to evolve with the passage of time and to embrace changes and challenges in this  ever  changing  landscape.  One  mandate  of  the  2023-2024, Guild  Executives  is  to  maintain  an  accessible,  welcoming,  and

culturally diverse online environment, and we will collaborate with a variety of stakeholders to support student success and the University's mission. All of us are faced with societal grief and challenges that have caused us to reflect and re-evaluate our position in society and beyond. As students,  we  are  expected  to  be  responsible  self-directed  learners  who  are  able  to  formulate learning goal and strategies for success. Therefore, on your educational journey, I implore you to  keep  moving  forward!  Remember,  every  step  you  take  to  learn  something  new  is  a  step towards a brighter future. You can do this!

There is an African proverb that I often reflect on, 'The sun does not forget a village because it is small.' I appreciate this proverb because it is easy for us students to feel small, inept, alone, and vulnerable. On this educational experience, I want to remind you that there are resources and support system to help you. Make the best use of all the assistance that are available to you. This academic year my plan is for the Student Guild to be the sun that shines on the small villages that make up our Guild Council.

Together we will focus on the theme 'Grow, Share, Believe' to support each other and provide resources to assist you in your academic journey. My goal as president is to create systems that will  support  all  students  to  achieve  their  academic,  professional,  and  community  goals.  This year the Guild plans to offer opportunities through programming, social events, and informational sessions on trending topics, career training, and special interests.

I  believe  this  is  a  time  for  us  to  be  bold  in  our  desire  to  make  education  better  and  more accessible for all students. My team and I are ready and willing to do the work to support you this academic year, but we cannot do it alone. It is critical for all of us to be committed to the charge  of  making  our  academic  journey  brighter  and  better.  As  your  2023-2024  President,  I plan  to  bring  bold  vision,  energy,  and  action  to  this  role  because  'Together  We  Can  Make  It Happen.'

Olson Browne Guild President - 2023-2024

## Part I: The University of the West Indies

## Background

The  University  of  the  West  Indies  has  the  unusual  distinction  of  being  the  sole  regional institution  of  higher  learning  serving  seventeen  Caribbean  countries:  Anguilla,  Antigua  and Barbuda,  the  Bahamas,  Barbados,  Belize,  Bermuda,  the  British  Virgin  Islands,  the  Cayman Islands, Dominica, Grenada, Jamaica, Montserrat, St. Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago and the Turks and Caicos Islands.  In addition, Guyana is a full participant in the Faculty of Law.

The  University  began  at  Mona,  Jamaica  in  1948  as  a  College  of  the  University  of  London.  It achieved full university status in 1962. The Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture in Trinidad was  converted  into  the  St.  Augustine  Campus  in  1961  and  in  1963  a  third  campus  was established at Cave Hill in Barbados. There is also a Centre for Hotel and Tourism Management in the Bahamas.

In  2007,  the  University  Council  approved  the  establishment  of  the  fourth  campus,  the  Open Campus,  (now  known  as  the  Global  Campus) to  enable  the  University  to  expand  the  scope, enhance the appeal and improve the efficiency of its service to the individuals, communities and countries which it serves across the region, the diaspora and beyond .    The Global Campus builds on the work and resources of the School of Continuing Studies, the Tertiary Level Institutions Unit  and  the  UWI  Distance  Education  Centre  to  increase  opportunities  for  access  to  tertiary education and provide an expanded range of programme offers and more coherent services to meet the needs of the communities we serve.  The academic year 2019/2020 saw the birth of a fifth campus, the Five Islands Campus located in Antigua and Barbuda.

Through  its  several  faculties  and  different  campuses,  The  UWI  offers  degree  programmes  in Agriculture,  Humanities,  Education,  Engineering,  Law,  Medical  Sciences,  Natural  Sciences  and Social Sciences.  The UWI maintains its presence and operations throughout the region through the Global Campus.  The Global Campus has a physical Site in each contributing country (except Bermuda) and functions as a network of real and virtual nodes to deliver education and training using  a  variety  of  instructional  methods  including  distance  education,  online  and  blended learning tools and face-to-face learning.  The Country Sites allow for the blending of online and face-to-face learning experiences and promote the enrichment of the social aspects of learning in a collegial environment.

As a regional institution, The UWI offers the rich and vibrant atmosphere that results from the interaction  of  students  connected,  yet  varied,  in  cultural  and  social  backgrounds.    A  strong emphasis  on  Caribbean  issues  in  both  teaching  and  research  makes  the  university  an  ideal learning ground for both regional and international students.

## The Coat of Arms of The University of the West Indies

<!-- image -->

The Coat of Arms of The University of the West Indies consists of a shield and a crest.

Forming the  main  background of  the  shield  is  the  sea  represented  by  white  and  blue  (three each) wavy lines on which is the open book; the upper part of the shield, the chief, is red with a Lion to show the connection with the Crown, but the Lion is covered with black spots.  This is the Lion borne by H.R.H. Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone, appointed by the King (George VI) to be the first Chancellor, so that this appointment is recorded forever in the Coat of Arms of the University.

The crest is the brown Pelican, which fishes in its prehistoric fashion along the coasts of all the Caribbean Lands; the  pelican is  a  symbol  of  care  for  the  young  because  of  the  medieval,  but untrue, belief that it punctures its breast to feed its young on its blood.  It is also used as a crest by both Corpus Christi Colleges of Oxford and Cambridge.

The motto is: Oriens ex Occidente Lux: A Light Rising from the West

## THE UWI GLOBAL CAMPUS

## Global Campus Roots

The UWI Global Campus and the support it provides to the region can trace its roots back to the birth of the University of the West Indies.  In 1948 the Extra-Mural Department of the university was established on the advice of the Irvine Committee of the Asquith Commission, whose report led to the establishment of the University College of the West Indies, as it was then known.  The Asquith Report strongly recommended that the new Commonwealth universities should take a leading part in the development of adult education in the territories in which they were located. Therefore,  from  the  very  start,  the  University  recognised  that  in  addition  to  teaching  and research, the institution had a responsibility to reach out directly into the community.

The Extra-Mural Department, which eventually evolved into the School of Continuing Studies, offered locally-driven programmes  of  public  education,  adult education  and  continuing education in contributing countries designed to enhance academic, professional and vocational skills, and to provide opportunities to pursue tertiary level studies.

The Tertiary Level Institutions Unit (TLIU) also worked to enhance access to tertiary education in the region by linking the University's resources, programmes  and  services to the development  of  tertiary  education  institutions.    The  TLIU  supported  the  development  of articulation  and  franchising  arrangements  with  tertiary  institutions  across  the  region  and engaged  in  special  projects  promoting  collaboration  and  cooperation  within  the  Caribbean tertiary education system.

In  1983,  The UWI began offering distance education courses using an audio-teleconferencing system  that  was  known  as  the  UWI  Distance  Teaching  Experiment  -  later  Enterprise  UWIDITE.  UWIDITE  course  delivery  was  primarily  via  teleconferencing  and  correspondence packages.  The name UWIDITE soon became associated with the audio-teleconferencing system through which The UWI made education and training more accessible, especially to people in the  Eastern  Caribbean.    Working  with  Faculties  across  the  University,  UWIDITE  produced learning packages and delivered courses through the teleconferencing system, which enabled students across the region to complete Part 1 of some degree programmes without attending a residential campus.

On August 1, 1996, the amalgamation of the Distance Education Unit, Challenge Examinations, and  UWIDITE  was  completed  with  the  establishment  of  the  Distance  Education  Centre (UWIDEC).  UWIDEC  undertook  to  create  a  blended  learning  environment  that  embraced asynchronous online delivery methods in combination with online tutors,  paper-based study material  and  teleconferences  for  planning,  guidance  and  examination  preparations.    This became known as the UWI Blended Learning Model.

The  range  of  courses  offered  was  expanded  to  facilitate  students  completing  full  degree programmes through distance technologies.  Thereafter, the drive was to improve the quality of The UWI distance education offerings and move towards being a full dual-mode institution in which  distance  education  programmes  are  offered  alongside  the  traditional  face-to-face programmes.

The latest  chapter in  expanding  the  reach  of  The  UWI  in  the  communities  we  serve  was  the creation of the Open Campus (now known as the Global Campus) in July 2008.  The Campus was created to improve the service to the UWI-12 countries and the underserved communities in residential campus countries that do not have access to the campus-based programmes and to provide flexible learning options.

## The Global Campus Guiding Principles

The  Global  Campus  of  The  University  of  the  West  Indies  is  based  on  the  idea  that  the  highquality university education, research and services available at our institution should be open and  available  to  all  people  who  wish  to  reach  their  full  potential  inside  and  outside  of  the Caribbean  region.    The  Global  Campus  will  adopt  quality  teaching  and  learning  experiences, innovative pedagogic design, relevant research and community partnerships to deliver face-toface, blended and online learning to all of its communities.

## The Organisational Structure of the Global Campus

The Global Campus is headed by a Pro Vice-Chancellor and Campus Principal who oversees the operations  of  the  campus.    The  campus  is  comprised  of  17  functional  units,  which  have responsibility  for  the  management  of  the  affairs  of  the  campus  and  the  delivery  of  its programmes and services.  The UWI Global Campus has administrative offices at Cave Hill, Mona and St. Augustine Campuses and Country Sites throughout the region (a list of Sites and contact information is provided at Appendix B or can be found at www.open.uwi.edu/locations).  Site Heads in each country manage the Global Campus' affairs for their country.  In addition, Site Coordinators manage the distance learning and face-to-face operations at delivery sites.

## PART II: ACADEMIC DIVISIONS, ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENTS, CENTRES, INSTITUTES AND RESEARCH UNITS

<!-- image -->

## Office of the Principal

The Campus Principal has overall responsibility for the academic, financial and administrative management of the Campus.

The  Planning  and  Institutional  Research  (PAIR)  Unit  ensures  that  institutional  research  is conducted on a regular basis to maintain the efficient functioning of all units within the Campus. The  office  is  headed  by  a  Planning  and  Development  Officer  who  works  closely  with  the University  Planning  and  Development  Office  to  monitor  progress  on  the  achievement  of  The UWI strategic objectives.

The Office of the Principal also collaborates closely with the University Management Auditor to facilitate  the  information  that  the  Global  Campus  will  require  to  maintain  a  high  degree  of excellence in its operations.

## Office of the Deputy Principal

This office coordinates the quality assurance function, including accreditation and the reviews of programmes,  has  oversight  of  the  Enterprise  Resource  Planning,  the  Student  Virtual Concierge Services and the Business Development Units. The Business Development Unit (BDU) is responsible  for  coordinating  the  Global  Campus'  entrepreneurial  activities  and  actively develops new revenue opportunities for the Campus utilising the skills and competencies of the staff of the Campus.

## Academic Programming and Delivery Division (APAD)

The  Academic  Programming  and  Delivery  Division  (APAD)  is  headed  by  the  Director  and  is responsible  for  leading  the  planning,  development  and  delivery  of  programmes.        APAD achieves this through regular assessment of programmes, courses and course delivery practices to ensure improved quality and the ability to understand and meet the academic needs of our students through programme variety and innovation.   In an attempt to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the development and delivery processes, APAD's operations focus on three functional areas: online programme planning and production, and online programme delivery. These areas are served by two department Heads who are responsible for shaping the academic services in their respective areas.

As  a  Global  Campus  student,  much  of  your  academic  support  and  course  delivery  will  be provided by staff from APAD.    The Division is responsible for the creation of all online courses and all workshops and programmes delivered to students.   In addition, the Division manages the  course  delivery  process,  including  the  hiring,  training,  supervision  and  evaluation  of  all course facilitators.    The Division also offers an Academic Support Team whose purpose is to ensure that you receive a high-quality learning experience.

## The Office of the Campus Registrar (The Registry)

The Registry is led by the Campus Registrar and is responsible for core matters related to the management of all student and staff administration as well as the Secretariat which assists the Campus Registrar in fulfilling her responsibilities as Secretary for the Campus Council and other Committees of the Campus.  The Campus Registrar also oversees the Records and Information Management Unit that ensures the proper storage, retrieval, disposal and archiving of Campus records.

The core areas within the Registry are: Recruitment, Admissions and Registration; Assessment, Awards and Records; Student Support and Services; Office of Graduate Studies and Research; the  Secretariat;  Human  Resource  Department  and  the  Records  and  Information  Management Unit. These sections are managed by a Senior Assistant Registrar, Assistant Registrars, Director and a Campus Records Manager functioning in a distributed environment across the Caribbean region and reporting to the Campus Registrar.

## GLOBAL CAMPUS SITES (OCCS)

The Global Campus Sites (GCS) is a division within The UWI Global Campus which directs the activities of Country Sites across the Caribbean region, under the leadership of a Director.   Country  Sites are  distributed  throughout  the  countries  served  by  The  UWI  Global Campus and are led by Heads, Officers-in-Charge, Country Manager (Trinidad and Tobago) and Manager (The British Overseas Territories).  The work of the Division is led by the Director with a  support  structure  in  the  Office  of  the  Director  which  includes  a  Deputy  Director,  one Administrative  Officer,  two  Administrative  Assistants  and  an  Enterprise  Resource  Planning (ERP) Unit.  The GCS Division currently serves thirty-eight (38) physical locations distributed throughout sixteen (16) English-speaking Caribbean countries.

The Global Campus Sites are located in Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, The Bahamas, Barbados, Belize,  the  British  Virgin  Islands  (BVI),  the  Cayman  Islands  (which  also serves students from Bermuda), Dominica, Grenada, Jamaica, Montserrat, St. Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago and Turks and Caicos Islands.  In addition, there are

three Open Learning Centres (OLCs) located at the Cave Hill, Mona and St. Augustine Campuses. These OLCs fall under Global Campus Barbados, Global Campus (Jamaica Eastern) and Global Campus Trinidad  and  Tobago  (specifically  Gordon  Street).  The  IT  Academy,  a  Cisco-certified entity situated in Trinidad, is also a Unit within the GCS Division.

The  Division's  efforts  to  fulfil  the  Global  Campus's  vision  of  being student-centred,  agile, accessible and enabling are pursued extensively.  Hence, the work undertaken by the Division is intended to empower staff, enrich the student experience, and broaden the scope of the Global Campus through outreach.  The operations of the Sites involve the expansion of Continuing and Professional  Education  (CPE)  programming  to  address  the  growing  need  for  professional development, marketing, community  partnerships, national or public service, research, outreach,  lectures,  seminars,  island  tours,  and  other  means  of  taking  the  Campus  beyond physical walls.

The  Office  of  Finance  is  responsible  for  the  financial  management,  accounting  and  control functions  of  the  Global  Campus,  including  financial  control  and  protection  of  the  Campus's assets.

The  Global  Campus  Finance  Division  currently  has  offices  in  three  locations,  in  Barbados, Trinidad  and  Tobago  and  Jamaica.    The  Division  is  responsible  for  the  day-to-day  finance operations  in  these  locations  for  all  Global  Campus  units.  Within  the  UWI-14  locations,  the finance function operates through a matrix structure where the Finance Office coordinates the finance activities at these Sites through staff assigned at each Site.

## Computing and Technical Services (CATS)

This division comprises the core specialist technical staff of the Global Campus and is led by the Chief  Information Officer.      It  manages  all  aspects  of  the  regional  technical  and  technological requirements of the Campus.

The  CATS  team  designs,  develops  and  maintains  systems  infrastructure  and  applications software to enable access to academic programming and business applications.  This division works  with  the  Office  of  the  Principal,  APAD,  the  Registry,  the  Library  and  the  other departments across the Global Campus to provide the services required by each area.

## Libraries and Information Services

The Global Campus Libraries and Information Services (GCLIS) provide a distributed service to the  Global  Campus  and  The  UWI  community.  The  GCLIS  provides  online  support  and  eresources, as well as print resources and face-to-face support at various Country Sites.

## The Consortium for Social Development and Research (CSDR)

The Consortium for Social Development and Research (CSDR) is responsible for the academic research  priorities  of  the  University  of  the  West  Indies  (UWI)  Global  Campus.  The  Division comprises four semi-autonomous research units - Hugh Shearer Labour Studies Institute, Social Work  Training  and  Research  Centre,  Women  and  Development  Unit  and  Caribbean  Child Development Centre, inclusive of the Bloom Early Childhood Centres of Excellence.

The CSDR continuously seeks to contribute to the social  development  of  Caribbean societies, strengthen  the  human  potential  of  citizens  and  promote  the  University  of  the  West  Indies,

especially  in  non-traditional  areas,  through  research,  training  and  education,  curriculum development, development projects, technical assistance, information management and community outreach and public service.

## The Caribbean Child Development Centre (CCDC)

Originally established as the Regional Preschool Child Development Centre in 1972, the Centre was  renamed  the  Caribbean  Child  Development  Centre  (CCDC)  in  1985  to  more  accurately reflect its evolving role in child development.

The Centre's mission is to provide support for the holistic development of Caribbean children, through  collaborative  research  to  inform  policy  and  programme  development,  information management and dissemination, teaching and training, public service and promotion of the best possible outcomes for children. Additionally, the Centre engages in projects, in partnership with private and public sectors as well as international organisations, to engender child, adolescent and youth protection, justice and development across the Caribbean region.

The Centre continues to offer pre-school education services to the University and surrounding communities  through  its  Early  Childhood  Centres  of  Excellence,  Bloom,  which  are  located  in Jamaica  and  Trinidad  &amp;  Tobago.  The  preschools  serve  as  laboratory  schools  in  play-based learning  that  seeks  to  stimulate  independent  thought,  socio-emotional  intelligence  and  self chosen learning in the toddlers.

## The Hugh Shearer Labour Studies Institute (HSLSI)

The  Hugh  Shearer  Labour  Studies  Institute  (HSLSI),  originally  named  the  Trade  Union Education  Institute,  was  gifted  to  the  Trade  Union  Movement  of  Jamaica  and  the  people  of Jamaica in 1963, by the United States Government. In 2008 the Institute was renamed the Hugh Lawson  Shearer  Trade  Union  Education  Institute,  in  honour  of  The  Right  Honourable,  Hugh Lawson Shearer, late former Prime Minister of Jamaica and Trade Union leader who is one of the  framers  of  the  concept  that  gave  birth  to  the  HSLSI.  The  HSLSI  was  established  to  train upper  level  trade  union  personnel  from  Jamaica  and  the  eastern  Caribbean  in  free  and democratic trade union leadership. Over time the needs of the Labour sector have changed and as  such,  the  Institute  had  to  evolve  to  stay  relevant  and  continue  to  serve  the  needs  of  the Jamaican people as well as the Eastern Caribbean.

Currently, the Institute conducts research in Labour and offers training programme designed to equip and sensitize members of the tripartite community (government, employers and trade unions) with the knowledge and skills to create a 21st century Labour force that is agile and ready  to  facilitate  the  development  goals  necessary  to  grow  and  sustain  the  Caribbean economies. The training programmes seek to expose participants to a range of disciplines to enhance  their  professional  development,  making  them  more  capable  of  performing  their  job functions, managing change and enhancing productivity throughout the organization.

The knowledge gained from the areas of research and reinforced through training will improve employee-employer relations within the workplace and improve the participants' knowledge of workplace procedures. In the current dispensation, it is important for employers and workers

to equip themselves with the requisite knowledge and skills to maximize performance/productivity in furtherance of serving the public good.

## The Social Work Training and Research Centre (SWTRC)

The Social Work Training and Research Centre (SWTRC), established in 1962, has almost sixty years' experience in the provision of continuing and professional education for paraprofessionals, social workers, youth workers and community development workers in the governmental and non-governmental sectors in the region.

The  SWTRC  continues  to  offer  skills  development  training  for  paraprofessionals.  They  also provide  upskilling  for  practicing  social  workers  in  core  areas  of  focus  to  help  sharpen  their expertise in niche areas such as play therapy, social work management, mental health, school social work, counselling for social workers and many other areas. Equally important, the Centre offers  training  to  other  professionals  through  short  courses  and  workshops  in  areas  such  as grant writing, research process and programme monitoring and evaluation.

As  a  research  institution  the  SWTRC  engages  in  applied  social  work  research,  with  a  strong focus on community development, mental health and youth development. It also offers research services such as data entry and analysis, proposal writing, instrument design and research skills training.  In addition, the SWTRC contributes to the dissemination of social work knowledge and best  practices  through  the  publication  of  the  Caribbean  Journal  of  Social  Work in  association with  the  Department  of  Sociology,  Psychology  and  Social  Work,  UWI  (Mona).  The  Caribbean Journal  of  Social  Work  is  the  official  journal  of  the  Association  of  Caribbean  Social  Work Educators.

## The Women and Development Unit (WAND)

WAND was established in 1978, after the UN Decade for Women conference in Beijing with a mandate to put women at the centre of community and development.

WAND's work involves inclusive, diverse and rights-centred community outreach, developing online  and  distance  learning  professional  courses  and  establishing  technical  partnerships  in applied  research  to  support  advocacy  and  policy  development;  all  of  which  are  aimed  at centering women and their families in Caribbean development.

WAND's  strategic  areas  focus  on  economic  and  political  participation,  youth  empowerment, vulnerable  populations  including  persons  with  disabilities,  LGBTQ+  people  and  children,  and sexual and reproductive health.

WAND's  online  learning  programme  offers  professional  courses  in  gender  and  inclusive development planning.

## The School For Graduate Studies And Research (SGSR)

The UWI Global Campus School for Graduate Studies and Research (SGSR) was established on August  1,  2020,  to  support  the  administrative,  academic  and  programming  functions  of  the Campus that serve research and postgraduate education. Under the leadership of the Director, this  Campus  arm  of  the  SGSR  manages  the  strategic  direction  of  graduate  studies,  assisting academic  divisions  in  developing  and  expanding  postgraduate  programmes  and  related

## PART III: LIFELONG LEARNING &amp; DISTANCE EDUCATION

<!-- image -->

## LIFELONG LEARNING

Lifelong Learning is a commitment to continuously acquire new knowledge and skills. The UWI Global  Campus  provides  opportunities  for  the  lifelong  learner  in  the  Caribbean.  We  are committed to fostering the interests of adult students and the lifelong learning community by working closely with our regional partners.

The UWI has a long tradition of outreach programmes that provide valuable opportunities for mature students to take courses on a part-time basis.  Both credit and non-credit courses are provided in a wide range of areas.  We offer basic education, the upgrading of professional and paraprofessional skills, as well as UWI Certificates, Diplomas and Degrees.

By enrolling in our programmes, large numbers of our people across the Caribbean region have benefited from the experience of study at an institution of higher learning and have been able to advance to tertiary education both within and outside of The UWI system. This work is a vital contribution to lifelong learning, and we attach high priority to its continuation.

## Studying at the Global Campus

Many successful  people  have  chosen  to  study  at  the  Global  Campus  as  it  provides  attractive options  for  lifelong  learning  and  career  development  in  a  variety  of  formats  and  modes  of delivery.   Some  of  the  reasons  that  learners  within  the  Caribbean  choose  the  Global  Campus include:

- 1. Access: The  Global  Campus  provides  opportunities for  students to  gain  access  to higher education.  The design of our programmes with entry at several levels allows more student access to The UWI through a number of different academic options.
- 2. Study at your own pace: The mixed mode teaching delivery method of the Global Campus allows students to organise their time to better fit in with their personal and employment commitments.  Students can achieve their academic goals on a flexible schedule.
- 3. Cost-effectiveness: It is becoming increasingly difficult for students to undertake full-time residential  study,  particularly  for  those  in  rural  districts  or  in  the  countries  of  the Caribbean without physical UWI campuses.  The Global Campus offers programmes at less cost than full-time residential study programmes.
- 4. In-country  education  and  training: One  of  our  advantages  is  the  very  nature  of  the Global  Campus  structure.   We  have  several  locations  in  contributing  countries  of  the University.   Many  of  our  programmes  offer  students  the  opportunity  to  study  while remaining  in  full-time  employment.   In  addition,  the  new  skills  and  knowledge  learned allow first-hand implementation in the work situation.
- 5. Professional Development: The Global Campus offers opportunities for persons to keep abreast of new ideas and concepts in their preferred fields of work or in disciplines. Our students are provided with a quality educational experience that promotes their academic and professional success.

## Distance Education

Distance education is  a  process  in  which  the  learners  and  their  instructors  are  separated  by time  and/or  distance.  Communication  and  interaction  is  facilitated  by  different  educational technologies and instructional strategies.

Communication  between  the  instructor  and  the  learner  is  non-contiguous  but  interactive, employing various media - print, audio, video - and various delivery methods - audio, video and computer and web conferencing, as well as email, rather than (but sometimes including) faceto-face methods.

There are two types of delivery methods:

- 1. Asynchronous delivery, which requires interaction and communication between participants that happen at different times; and
- 2. Synchronous  delivery  that  requires  interaction  and  communication  in  real  time,  with learner and facilitator, in different geographical locations.

## How to Succeed in Studying at a Distance

As students you are entering a learning environment that may be foreign to many of you.  It is unlike any traditional classroom experience you have ever had. To succeed, first and foremost you must be motivated and able to manage your own learning experiences. Learning is your responsibility. The UWI  Global Campus  strives to create the best possible learning environment for you and your peers, and therefore will provide the resources and facilitators you need to achieve your academic goals.

You  may,  at  times,  experience  a  feeling  of  isolation  and  loneliness.   This  does  not  need  to happen.  You must learn to virtually network with your peers and supporting members of staff as well as make the most of the online and communications tools that the Global Campus has provided.   You  should  regularly  attend  any  teleconferences,  web  conferencing  or  face-to-face

meetings  organized  by  your  Course  Coordinator,  e-Tutor,  and  other  members  of  staff  in  the Academic Programming and Delivery Division (APAD). Below are some tips to consider or skills you need to master.

- 1. Time  Management -  One  of  the  biggest  problems  when  studying  at  a  distance  is  the inability to manage your time.  The average online course requires ten to twelve hours of online and offline activities each week.  That means you need to create a study schedule and stick to it.  You need to dedicate time to complete your assignments and exercises on time.
- 2. Personal  Organisation -  You  need  to  ensure  you  have  a  process  for  managing  the resources, readings and discussions you will be required to complete as you move through your  programme.   You  need  to  create  a  system  for  capturing  websites  and  other  online resources that may be needed in the courses in your academic programme.
- 3. Research Skills - Most courses require learners to investigate or produce unique products or papers that require independent research.  You must learn how to use the online library and how to critically analyse and summarize papers, journal articles and books.
- 4. Family Obligations - Many of you will have families.  As you study, you must ensure that your  family  knows  when  you  are  available  and  when  you  need  to  have  quiet  time  to study.  One strategy is to involve them in creating a study schedule and posting it where everyone can see it.
- 5. Separate Study Area -  You  need to ensure that you have a separate study area that is quiet and free from distractions.   It  should ideally be an area where you can leave your study material and readings out as you move through the course .
- 6. Communications Skills - Because much of the interaction and communication in distance education is through the written word, you must be able to effectively communicate in the English language.
- 7. Technical  Skills -  If  you  are  not  computer  literate,  you  must  become  so  if  you  are  to succeed  in  a  distance-learning  environment.   You  will  be  required  to  create  Word documents; Excel spread sheets, PowerPoint slides and work with different web communication and research tools.

## Working With Your Online Department

Most  online  courses  have  both  a  Course  Instructor  (CI)  and  a  number  of  Markers.   The  CI manages the course and serves as the academic leader. He or she customises the course page and manages the Markers assigned to the course. Students are divided into separate groups for marking purposes only. Each group will be assigned a dedicated Marker to grade assignments and  to  provide  feedback  to  learners.   Students  will  experience  all  other  course  activities collectively.

An Online Teaching Assistant (OTA) is also assigned to larger courses. The specific duty of the OTA is to support the CI during live sessions and in the various course forums as needed.

We expect students to view their OTA and CI as people who are there to facilitate their learning and assist them to succeed.  Students should not hesitate to ask facilitators questions; this sort of exchange is expected as we encourage accountability and active participation in this learning partnership. If students seek to learn more about a specific concept or topic they should freely engage facilitators for guidance about additional resources. If they are struggling with a concept or  idea,  then  we  expect  them  to  share  their  concerns  with  their  OTA  and/or  CI.  He  or  she  is there to help students master these concepts.

## Format of Global Campus Courses for Regional Programmes

The Global Campus has a mix of blended and fully online courses. There are currently two types because of the evolution from self-study, teleconference supported courses to blended learning courses, to fully online courses.  Let us explore each format:

Fully  Online  Courses -  Fully  online  courses  are  delivered  via  the  Global  Campus  Moodle Learning Management System, referred to as the Learning Exchange (LE) .  In  this  modality  all course instruction and assessments are offered online in the LE supported by course material and  various  learning  technologies.  Some  courses  may  require  an  additional  text.  When  this situation  arises,  you  will  be  required  to  pay  the  full  amount  of  the  cost  of  that  additional textbook. You may also purchase any additional material resource through online bookstores. Your Course Instructor will advise you if this is needed.

Global Campus students registered in fully online courses come from different countries. With the diversity of cultures, you have the opportunity to engage in meaningful and cross-cultural debates, work-based exercises and case studies within a learning environment that promotes a community of learners and cooperative and collaborative skills. Courses are interactive in their design and require regular communication and information sharing with peers and the course facilitators.  These  fully  online  courses  require  learners  to  actively  participate  in  all  online discussions  and  small  group  work  interaction  among  peers.  Courses  are  supported  through synchronous  sessions  via  Zoom  through  the LE . In  this  environment  you  and  your  Course Instructor meet in real time to discuss course content and expectations.

Blended Learning Courses -  Blended  learning  courses  are  a  mix  of  face-to-face  and  online delivery via the Learning Exchange.

The blended modality in the Global Campus is configured as follows:

- a. Online delivery, inclusive of synchronous web conferencing sessions on Zoom; and faceto-face examinations;
- b. Online  delivery  as  indicated  in  'a'  above;  as  well  as  face-to-face  classes  and/or  field supervised instruction; and
- c. Study  materials,  including  online  files,  along  with  synchronous  and  asynchronous activities offered in the LE .

The blended learning courses require learners to regularly interact online in their course and to complete  assessments  online.  Interaction  online  includes  discussion  exercises  on  forums  for development  of critical thinking skills, journaling, reflective practice, use of tools for collaboration and cooperative learning and activities that promote development of leadership skills.

Face-to-Face Learning Modality - In addition to the online and the blended courses, the Global Campus facilitates the design and delivery of face-to-face university credit, as well as not-forcredit courses, workshops and seminars. Many of the courses and programmes offered by the Global  Campus  are  developed  in  response  to  particular  local  needs.  To  ensure  that  the  local professional development  and  academic needs in different countries and communities throughout the Caribbean are supported, the Global Campus will continue to deliver face-to-face learning  experiences.   Some  will  be  professional development  experiences  and  others  will  be courses  that  are  completed  for  credit  in  a  specific  programme  approved  by  The  UWI.   Site Coordinators  and  Site  Heads  organize  and  conduct  these  workshops,  seminars  and  courses, with the support of the Continuing and Professional Education Centre and Academic Programming and Delivery Division through its curriculum development and production teams.

## Quality of the Distance Learning Experience

The University of the West Indies is a dual mode institution that offers a variety of programme methodologies both by face-to-face  and  distance education methods.  Degrees completed  at  a distance  are  equal  in  quality  to  those  taken  in  the  face-to-face  mode  on  The  UWI  physical campuses.  Like  the  physical  campuses  The  UWI  Global  Campus,  through  its  curriculum, prepares its students with the academic abilities, skills, and personal and professional attributes required of The UWI graduate.

## The attributes of the Distinctive UWI Graduate are:

- 1. A critical and creative thinker;
- 2. an effective communicator with good interpersonal skills;
- 3. IT-skilled and information literate;
- 4. innovative and entrepreneurial;
- 5. globally aware and well-grounded in his/her regional identity;
- 6. socially, culturally and environmentally responsible; and
- 7. guided by strong ethical values.

## Accreditation of The UWI Global Campus

The University of the West Indies, Global Campus has institutional accreditation awarded by the Barbados Accreditation Council until 26 July 2026. As accreditation does not cross geographical boundaries, the University applied for and was granted mutual recognition in all contributing countries by either the external quality assurance agency or relevant ministry, where no agency exists,  including  from  the  Accreditation  Council  of  Trinidad  and  Tobago  and  the  University Council of Jamaica.

Mutual  recognition  means  that  the  agency  or  ministry  has  agreed  to  accept  the  institutional accreditation decision of another agency, in this case of the Barbados Accreditation Council, and to recognize  the  institution  as  one  that  meets  external  quality  standards.    Part  of  the requirements for maintenance of institutional accreditation is that the Global Campus annually submits  reports  to  the  Barbados  Accreditation  Council  and  entities  granting  it  mutual recognition showing how it has sustained and improved on the quality of its provisions over the period under review.

The achievement of institutional accreditation by an external quality assurance agency signals that an institution has been assessed as having the appropriate systems and processes in place to develop and deliver programmes and services of high quality.

## Qualifying Tests and Remedial Courses

## The English Language Proficiency Test (ELPT)

All  students  who  do  not  have  the  qualifications  to  allow  them  to  register  for English  for

Academic Purposes (FOUN1001) must take the English Language Proficiency Test (ELPT). For a list of qualifications exempting students from taking the ELPT, please visit http://www.open.uwi.edu/admissions

## Remedial Mathematics

An approved qualification in Mathematics is a requirement for entry into certain BSc and ASc programmes.

Approved  remedial  Mathematics  courses  include Improving  Your  Math  Skills  (IYMS)  and  MATH0900 Mathematics (for  ASc  students).   Please consult your nearest Site office with respect to the course on offer.

A pass in CXC-CSEC or GCE 'O' Level Mathematics is a prerequisite for ECON1003 Mathematics for the Social Sciences .  You are required to obtain the requisite pass in one of these Mathematics courses  or  an  approved  remedial  Mathematics  course  before  you  are  allowed  to  register  for ECON1003.

## Credit Exemptions

All students  must  note  that  there  are  two  separate  procedures  for  students  who  need exemptions processed. PROCEDURE 1: APPLICATIONS BASED ON APPROVED EXEMPTION LISTING PROVIDED AND PROCEDURE 2:  APPLICATIONS FOR THOSE WHO NEED TO HAVE THEIR  EXEMPTION  REQUESTS  ASSESSED  TO  DETERMINE  IF  THEY  ARE  ELIGIBLLE  FOR EXEMPTIONS. Please  note  that  there  are  no  deadline  dates  for  a  Procedure  1  exemption request. However, if you wish to request Procedure 2 exemptions, you must do so by the end of the  third  week  of  classes  of  Semesters  I  and II. All requests  should  be  made  to  the  Registry (Student Support and Services) using the relevant exemption application form available in your MyOC Student Services Portal under the Forms and Booklets Resources Section.  Every semester the guidelines for the exemption requests will be emailed directly to students.

An official transcript will be required for assessment by the authorised body, unless the courses for which you are seeking exemption are from programmes/courses students have completed through The UWI. For those exemption requests that have not been assessed previously by The UWI,  you  will  need  to  submit  course  outlines  and  transcripts  to  facilitate  the  analysis  for equivalence. Incomplete packages will not be processed.

The  granting  of  exemptions  (and  credits)  for  non-UWI  programmes  must  be  based  on equivalency to courses in each degree option.  If a course, already completed successfully, is the same as that  to  be  pursued  at  a  particular  level,  a  student  may  receive  exemption  from  that course.   In  keeping  with  The  UWI's  policy,  exemptions  (and  credits)  will  only  be  granted  for courses that have been successfully pursued within the last five (5) years. Credit exemptions do not count towards the GPA.

## PART VI:  EXAMINATIONS

<!-- image -->

For some courses, you may be required to do assignments, sit mid-semester tests as well as endof-semester  examinations.    Examinations  are  held  at  designated  examination  centres  (for example,  a  Global  Campus  Site)  in  your  country  or  online.    Some  courses  may  have  an alternative to the final examination, such as a major project/action research.

Examinations are  different from assignments, quizzes or online tests that might be a part of your  coursework.    Examinations  must  be  written  in  a supervised  environment , with  an approved Examination Invigilator (Proctor/Supervisor).

## Global Campus Examinations

The UWI has five (5) campuses; in most cases, examination papers are different for each campus for logistical reasons.  Therefore, when attending an examination, you should ensure that the examination  paper  is  the  one  prescribed  for Global  Campus  students -  this  will  be  clearly stated at the top of the examination paper.

All  written  final  examinations  have  sessions  scheduled  either  for  the  morning  (9:00  a.m.), afternoon (1:00 p.m.), or evening (4:00 p.m.) and are two (2) or three (3) hours in duration. In some exceptional cases, examinations may be scheduled on public holidays.

Mid-semester examinations are usually held from 5:00 p.m.

## Global Campus Examinations Timetable

The Examinations Timetable for students of the Global Campus is scheduled differently from the one for students at any of the landed Campuses. Make sure that the Examinations Timetable from which you take your schedule is the Global Campus Examinations Timetable.

## Writing Examinations at Your Global Campus Site/Examination Centre

On acceptance to the Global Campus, you were assigned to a Site.  You are expected to write your  examinations  at  this  Site with  the  exception  of students  assigned  to  the  Virtual International Students Office (VISO).  When you register for a course, you are simultaneously registering  for  the  examination;  therefore,  you  are  not  required  to  make  any  additional arrangements  to  be  examined.    You  are  simply  required  to  check  with  your  Site  to  find  out which room your examination will be taking place in - this information is usually provided via the Sites' Notice Boards.

## Writing Examinations at an Alternate Global Campus Site

If you are unable to write examinations at the Global Campus Site at which you are registered, you must formally make a request to write them at another Global Campus Site .    To  do this,  you must make the request to the Assistant Registrar, Assessment, Awards and Records, Global Campus, through your Site Head or Site Coordinator by completing the required form at https://goo.gl/forms/8FyoIm4vg0FKF8Sd2 at  least  twenty-one  (21)  days  ahead of  your examination(s) to make sure that you can be accommodated.  There is a late application fee of US$30.00 or the equivalent in your local currency for requests made after this date and no later than one (1) week before the start of the examinations period.  We cannot accommodate requests made less than seven (7) days before your examination. Students failing to make requests in a timely manner and are subsequently absent from their examinations will be subject  to  the  usual  penalties  for  absence  and  will  be  deemed  to  have  failed  the examination.

## Writing Examinations Outside of Countries with UWI Examination Centres

If  you  wish  to  take  your  written  examination(s)  at  a  location  other  than  a  UWI  Examination Centre, you are required to identify a proctor at an accredited post-secondary institution such as  a  University,  Community  College  or  Technical  Institute  and  your  examination  must  be supervised by a professor, instructor or otherwise qualified person.  Alternately, you may take your examination at an Embassy or Consulate that offers proctoring services to international students. The proctoring institution MUST be able to communicate in English in order for your examinations to be facilitated.

It is the student's responsibility to identify a suitable proctor sixty ( 60) days in advance of the examination.    To  do  this,  you  must  complete  an EXTERNAL PROCTOR FORM found  on  the Student Portal and submit it to the Assistant Registrar, Assessment, Awards and Records for evaluation and approval of the proctor.  The completed proctor form should be submitted via the link on the student portal or by post to the address indicated below:

The Assistant Registrar

Assessment, Awards and Records The University of the West Indies Global Campus Learning Centre Cave Hill Campus P.O. Box 1341 Bridgetown BB11000

BARBADOS

## Fees for Writing Examinations Outside of a UWI Examination Centre

The UWI does not charge an examination fee, however, students are required to cover the cost of  couriering their examination papers to the proctoring institution and the cost of returning their completed scripts to The UWI for marking.  The cost of this courier service is US$120.00 and must be paid thirty (30) days in advance of your examination .

Upon  receipt  of  your  request  to  be  proctored  externally  and  as  soon  as  your  proctor  is approved, you will be billed for the courier cost.  You should access the Payment Gateway and make  the  payment at  least  thirty  (30)  days  before  your  examination .    Your  examination cannot be sent off until your payment has been made.  Under no circumstances will examination papers be couriered less than ten (10) days before the date of the examination.  Students should therefore make their payments on time.

## Instructions to Candidates Taking a Written Examination

- 1. It is your responsibility to ascertain the dates and times of the examination(s) for which you are registered.

## Absence from Examinations

When you register at the beginning of the Semester for any course, you are at the same time registering to be examined for that course. If you register for a course and do not take the examination you will be recorded as Failed Absent/FA and the usual penalties for a failure will apply.

Please note that the Assessment Regulations for First Degrees, Associate Degrees, Undergraduate Diplomas and Certificates state:

Any student who, having registered for a course, fails to take the examination, shall be  deemed  to  have  failed  the  examination  unless  the  relevant  Academic  Board decides otherwise, on the recommendation of the relevant Faculty Board.

## Late Withdrawal from a Course/Examination after the Deadline

A  student  may  withdraw  from  a  course  during  the  official  registration  period.    Additionally, students may apply for late de-registration after the official registration period has ended but before  the  end  of  the  sixth  (6 th )  week  of  teaching . Approval  for  de-registration  will  be determined by the Academic, Programming and Delivery Division.

If  a  student  is  granted  permission  to  withdraw  from  a  course  after  the  official  registration period has ended but before the end of the 6th week of teaching, a final grade definition of LW (Late Withdrawal) shall be assigned.  An LW grade has no impact on a student's GPA.

If a student stops attending the course and does not officially withdraw, a final grade definition of FA (Failed/Absent) will be assigned and will have a negative impact on the GPA.

Withdrawals are not permitted once grades have been posted for the semester.  If a student has documentable, extenuating circumstances, a petition may be submitted for review.

Withdrawing  from  course(s),  after  the  deadline,  does  not  relieve  the  student  from financial liability.

## Absence from Examinations Due to Illness

You must request  permission  for  absence  from  an  examination  due  to  illness;  however,  you must support your request with a medical report submitted  through  your  Site  Head or  Site Coordinator to the Campus Registrar (through the Assistant Registrar, Assessment, Awards and Records, Global Campus) within seven (7) days from the date of the examination in which your performance was affected.  The medical report should give brief details of the nature of the illness without breaching medical ethics.  Consideration for absence cannot be given if the medical report submitted does not state the nature of your illness.

The Assessment Regulations for First Degrees, Associate Degrees, Undergraduate Diplomas and Certificates state inter alia that:

- (a) Where the performance of a candidate in any part of any examination is likely to have been affected by factors of which the Examiners have no knowledge, or where the candidate is absent from the examination due to such factors, the candidate may report the circumstances in writing to the Campus Registrar. If the candidate decides to report such circumstances, he/she must do so within seven (7) days of that part of the examination which may have been affected ;
- (b) Where  the  factors  referred  to  in  (a)  relate  to  illness  the  Report  to  the  Campus Registrar must be accompanied by a medical report signed by a Campus Medical Officer, as proof of illness; or, in the case of the Open Campus, by any other medical practitioner approved for that purpose by the Campus Registrar.
- (c) The medical report shall be submitted within seven (7) days from the date of that  part  of  the  assessment  in  which  the  performance  of  the  candidate  is affected . A report received after this period will be considered only in exceptional circumstances;
- (d) Where  a  student  is  unable  to  submit  a  medical  report  in  person,  the  Campus Medical Officer  or  a  Medical  Practitioner,  as  the  case  may  be,  may  do  so  on  the student's behalf within the prescribed time;
- (e) The Campus Registrar shall pass on the information on illness or other factors as communicated in (a) - (d) above, to the Chair of the Board of Examiners to assist the Board in the performance of its duties in finalizing the student's examination record by awarding an appropriate final mark, or an appropriate designation, in accordance with the Grade Point Average Regulations; and

The options available in requesting a review are as follows:

- (b)  Any  student  may  apply  for  a  re-mark  of  his/her  examination.  An administrative  fee  of  BDS$130.00  or  its  equivalent  is  payable  to  the Bursary for the re-mark to be processed and may only be refunded in accordance with Regulation 145.
- 143. (a) During the consultation the Examiner may disclose the marks/grades;
- (b) The  process  of consultation should  include failed answers  in multiple-choice examinations; and

The administrative fee of BDS$130.00 or its equivalent is payable to the Bursary for the re-mark to be processed and will only be refunded in accordance with Regulation 145.
- 145. Where the remarking of a script under Regulation 142 or Regulation 144 results in a higher grade than that previously awarded, the administrative fee must be refunded.

The form can be found on the MyOC Student Portal Dashboard under Student Services; Forms and Booklets. The form is opened, to receive applications, from the deadline date for the release of results for any particular semester.

Marking Scheme for Graduate Diplomas and Degrees

The  marking  scheme  for  graduate  degrees  and  diplomas  is  different  from  the  marking scheme/grading policy for undergraduate students.  Please  refer  to  the  Grade  Point  Average Regulations for Graduate Programmes at

https://www.open.uwi.edu/sites/default/files/GPA\_Regulations\_Graduate\_Certificates\_Diplom as\_Taught\_Masters\_Professional\_Doctorate\_Programmes.pdf.

Graduate Programmes are governed by the Board for Graduate Studies and Research and there are separate Regulations for Graduate Diplomas and Degrees (2014).  These Regulations can be found on The UWI Graduate Studies and Research Information Portal http://www.uwi.edu/grip. You should familiarize yourself with the Regulations for Graduate Diplomas and Degrees found on the Global Campus or Graduate Studies websites at https://www.open.uwi.edu/gsr/graduate-student-handbook.

## THE UNIVERSITY'S PLAGIARISM REGULATIONS (First Degrees, Diplomas and Certificates)

## Application of these Regulations

- 1. These  Regulations  apply  to  the  presentation  of  work  by  a  student  for  evaluation, whether or not for credit, but do not apply to invigilated written examinations.

## Definition of plagiarism

- 2. In these Regulations, 'plagiarism' means the unacknowledged use of the words, ideas or creations of another  and  includes  situations where  the  student  reuses without acknowledgement their own previously  written  text,  ideas  or  creations  when  writing any  new  work.  'Level  1  plagiarism'  occurs  where  small  quantities  of  the  work  are affected  and/or  the  breaches  are minor.  It includes  borderline situations, cosmetic  or poor  paraphrasing,  negligent  referencing  or  incorrect  or  missing  citations.  'Level  2 plagiarism' occurs where large quantities of the work are affected and/or the breaches are serious. It includes situations in which a significant amount of material is borrowed or directly quoted or cosmetically paraphrased with no attribution at all, or attribution insufficient to indicate that the borrowed material is not the work of the student.
- 3. What may otherwise meet the definition of plagiarism may be justified for the purposes of  Regulation  2  where  the  particular  unacknowledged  use  of  the  words,  ideas  and creations of another is by the standards of the relevant academic discipline a function of part or all of the object of the work for evaluation whether or not for credit, for example:
- (a) The unacknowledged use is required for conformity with presentation standards;
- (b) The task set or undertaken is one of translation of the work of another into a different language or format;
- (c) The task set or undertaken requires producing a result by teamwork for joint credit regardless of the level of individual contribution;
- (d) The  task  set  or  undertaken  requires  extensive  adaptation  of  models  within  a time period of such brevity as to exclude extensive attribution;
- (e) The task set or undertaken requires the use of an artificial language, such as is the  case  with  computer  programming,  where  the  use  of  unoriginal  verbal formulae is essential.
- 4. It  is  not  a  justification  under  Regulations  2  and  3  for  the  unacknowledged  use  of  the words,  ideas  and  creations  of  another  that  the  user  enjoys  the  right  of  use  of  those words, ideas and creations as a matter of intellectual property.

## Other definitions

- 5. In  these  Regulations,  'Chair'  means  the  Chair  of  the  relevant  Campus  Committee  on Examinations;  'Examination  Regulations'  means  the  Examination  and  other  forms  of Assessment Regulations for First Degrees Associate Degrees Diplomas and Certificates of the University; 'set of facts' means a fact or combination of facts.

## Evidence of plagiarism

- 6. In  order  to  constitute  evidence  of  plagiarism  under  these  Regulations,  there  must  be identified  as  a  minimum  the  passage  or  passages  in  the  student's  work  which  are considered  to  have  been  plagiarised  and  the  passage  or  passages  from  which  the passages in the student's work are considered to have been derived.

## Student certification

- 7. When a student submits for examination work under Regulation 1, the student shall sign a statement, in such form as the Campus Registrar may prescribe, that as far as possible the work submitted is free of plagiarism including unattributed quotation or paraphrase of the work of another except where justified under Regulation 3.
- 8. Quotation or paraphrase is attributed for the purpose of Regulation 7 if the writer has indicated that the work is not the writer's own, even if the source is not identified.
- 9. Accurate  certification  under  Regulation  7  is  not  conclusive  as  to  the  absence  of plagiarism  under  these  Regulations.  Absence  of  certification  does  not  prohibit  the University from proceeding with a charge of plagiarism.

## Electronic vetting for plagiarism

- 10. The Campus Registrar may authorised or direct, with the consent of the student, that work submitted under Regulation 7 be subjected to electronic scrutiny in order to verify its freedom from plagiarism before being submitted to the Examiners. The results of the electronic scrutiny shall be submitted to the Dean and the Head of Department as well as to the Examiners, but the results of such electronic scrutiny although capable, where the requirements  of  Regulation  6  are  satisfied,  of  constituting  evidence  under  these Regulations, are not thereby conclusive of any question as to whether or not plagiarism exists.
- 11. Where a Dean or Head of Department considers that the procedure under Regulation 10 discloses evidence of plagiarism, the Dean or Head of Department, as the case may be, shall:
- (a) where the procedure is considered to disclose evidence of Level 2 plagiarism, report the matter to the Campus Registrar under Regulation 15(a); or
- (b) where the procedure is considered to disclose evidence of Level 1 plagiarism, refer the matter to the Examiners for their consideration as a charge of Level 1 plagiarism under Regulation 12.

## Level 1 plagiarism

- 12. In  work  submitted  for  examination  where  the  Examiner  is  satisfied  that  Level  1 plagiarism  has  been  committed,  he  shall  levy  a  penalty  for  the  Level  1  plagiarism charged in the form of a reduction in the marks ( up to a maximum of 10% ) which would have otherwise been awarded.

## Level 2 plagiarism

- 13. Where an Examiner has evidence of Level 2 plagiarism in the material being examined, that examiner must report it to the Head of Department or the Dean and may at any time provide the Registrar with a copy of that report.
- 14. Where any other person who in the course of duty sees material being examined that has  evidence  of  Level  2  plagiarism  that  other  person  may  report  it  to  the  Head  of Department or the Dean and may at any time report it to the Campus Registrar who shall take such action as may be appropriate.
- 15. Where a Dean or Head of Department receives a report under Regulation 13, the Dean or Head of Department, as the case may be, shall:
- (a) Where  in  concurrence  with  the  report's  identification  of  evidence  of  Level  2 plagiarism, report the matter to the Campus Registrar; or
- (b) Where not concurring in the identification of evidence of plagiarism, reply to the Examiner declining to proceed further on the Examiner's report; or
- (c) Where  concluding  that  there  is  evidence  of  Level  1  plagiarism,  reply  to  the Examiner indicating that conclusion and proceed as under Regulation 12.
- 16. Where a report is made to the Campus Registrar under Regulation 15(a) or Regulation 17,  the  Campus  Registrar  shall  lay  a  charge  and  refer  the  matter  to  the  Campus Committee on Examinations.
- 17. Where the Campus Registrar receives a report from the Examiner or any other person, the Campus Registrar shall refer the matter to a senior academic to determine evidence to  ground  a  charge  of  plagiarism  and  where  there  is  a  ground,  the  Campus  Registrar shall proceed as under Regulation 16.
- 18. Where  the  matter  has  been  referred  to  the  Campus  Committee  on  Examinations pursuant to Regulation 16, the proceedings under these Regulations prevail, subject to Regulation 19, over any other disciplinary proceedings against the student based on the same  facts  and,  without  prejudice  to  Regulation  24,  any  other  such  disciplinary proceedings must be stayed, subject to being reopened.
- 19. Where other disciplinary proceedings based on the same facts have been completed or have reached the stage of a hearing, whichever comes first, any proceedings under these Regulations based on a charge of Level 2 plagiarism shall be terminated.

20.

- (a) If  the  Campus Committee on Examinations is satisfied, after holding a hearing, that the  student  has  committed  Level  2  plagiarism,  it  shall  in  making  a determination on the severity of the penalty take into consideration:
- i. the circumstances of the particular case;

- ii. the seniority of the student; and
- iii. whether  this  is  the  first  or  a  repeated  incidence  of  Level  2 plagiarism.
- (b) Where a recommendation is made to fail the student, the Campus Committee on Examinations  shall  make  that  recommendation  to  the  Campus  Registrar  who shall refer it to the Academic Board for the student to be failed.
- 21. Academic Board may also, if the Campus Committee on Examinations so recommends after  being  satisfied  that  the  student  has  committed  Level  2  plagiarism,  exclude  the student  from  all  further  examinations  of  the  University  for  such  period  as  it  may determine.
- 22. Academic Board may also, if the Campus Committee on Examinations so recommends after  being  satisfied  that  the  student  has  committed  Level  2  plagiarism,  dismiss  the candidate from the University.

## Clearance on a charge of Level 2 plagiarism

- 23. A determination of the Campus Committee on Examinations that Level 2 plagiarism has not  been  found  will  be  reported  to  the  Campus  Registrar  who  shall  refer  it  to  the appropriate authority and notify the student. Where the Committee has not identified Level 2 but has identified Level 1, it shall be reported to the Campus Registrar who shall refer it to the Examiner.

## Level 2 plagiarism: Appeal to the Senate

- 24. A  student  may  appeal  to  the  Senate  from  any  decision  of  the  Campus  Committee  on Examinations under Regulations 20 and 21 and of Academic Board under Regulation 22.

## Delegation by Dean or Head of Department

- 25. The Dean or Head of Department, as the case may be, may generally or in a particular instance delegate that officer's functions under these Regulations.

## Examiner's conflict of interest disqualification

- 26. Any person who has at any time been an Examiner of work in relation to which an issue of plagiarism  is  being  considered  under  these  Regulations  must  withdraw  from performing any functions under these Regulations other than those of supervisor and Examiner.

## PART VII:  ACADEMIC SUPPORT SERVICES FOR ONLINE STUDENTS

<!-- image -->

The Global Campus (GC) has implemented academic support systems to ensure that students in online programmes and courses enjoy a meaningful virtual online learning experience, and that all  their  academic  concerns  are  heard  and  addressed.  Access  to  online  academic  support  is provided by the Online Programmes Delivery Department in the Academic Programming and Delivery division (APAD) of the Global Campus (OPDD/APAD).

Some of the online support provided include online orientation for new students; pre-course and programme advising conducted prior to the start of course registration; access to various APAD  support  staff  during  course  delivery;  and  the  opportunity  to  connect  with  other  UWI Global Campus students virtually, across online programmes via the ' Connecting As Students' (CAS ) space .

## The UWI Global Campus Undergraduate Orientation

A  key  part  of  the  academic  success  of  our  online  students  is  their  efficient  use  of  our  online infrastructure and resources. The best way that students can strengthen their online academic performance  is  to  use  the  guidance  that  we  provide  to  learn  how  to  master  their  online classroom spaces and all  other  resources  provided  by  the  various  student  support  units.  We highly  encourage  all  students  to  participate  fully  in  all  orientation  activities,  inclusive  of orientations led by colleagues at the Global Campus Sites (GCS).  GSC staff will contact students directly with information about the respective orientation sessions.

## Asynchronous and synchronous online orientation activities

The  OPDD  orientation  is  delivered  fully  online  and  comprises  both  asynchronous  and  live activities via Zoom. Students should expect to interact with content in various formats (i.e., text, audio, video, images), engage in forums, be routed directly to various GC resources, and become

acquainted with the Academic Support team who manages the online orientation activities. In addition, to the asynchronous activities aforementioned, students will be invited to meet with the  Academic Support team for a  live introductory  session  where  the  events  of  the  next  few months  will  be  discussed  (i.e.,  orientation,  registration  for  courses,  access  to  courses).  In preparation  for  course  registration,  students  will  be  invited  to  join  another  live  session  with their  respective Programme Manager. In this session, programme structure, advice on course selections, and other programme-related matters are addressed. The dates for these sessions are listed in the Academic Calendar.

## OPDD Orientation Part 1 (highly recommended)

The  orientation  is  divided  into  two  parts.  Part  1  is  accessible  online  via  the  Global  Campus website and is open to everyone who visits the page. While students' engagement in Part 1 is not  mandatory,  it  is  very  highly  recommended.  In  Part  1  we  begin  to  introduce  incoming students to topics that prepare them for the GC student life. We also share updates on upcoming live sessions and events leading up to the start of the semester. Students are advised on system requirements  for  accessing  the  GC  online  infrastructure  and  resources  and  how  to  navigate these  resources;  they  are  introduced  to  various  student  support  units,  etc.  We  also  highlight important documents to prepare students to become aware of their rights and responsibilities and how to become successful online learners.

## OPDD Orientation Part 2 (mandatory)

Part  2  is  our  chance  to  present  new  students  with  material  essential  to  their  effective functioning as a GC student. We revisit strategies for successful online learning and important rights  and  responsibilities.  We  also  highlight  the  various  learning  technologies  used  in  our courses among other key topics.

Part 2 of the orientation is mandatory and is embedded into select Level 1 courses. We present students with introductory information about  the campus  and  their  eventual learning experience and subsequently provide review quizzes on this material. Successful completion of Part 2 is required before students move on to the core content of each of the selected Level 1 courses. This is a requirement for students commencing studies from Semester 1, 2023/24 and onwards.

## Pre-Course Programme Advising

Students  are  encouraged  to  seek  programme  advice  prior  to  registering  for  courses  each semester.  Programme  Advising  documents  are  prepared  by  the  Programme  Managers  and provide an outline of the programme structure, the prescribed order for course completion, and other information to prepare students to successfully complete their programmes of study.

To receive programme advice, students should:

- 1)
- Carefully  review  the  Programme Advising documents available on the Global Campus website: https://www.open.uwi.edu/undergraduate/programme-advising
- 2) Contact their Programme Manager via email should they require further information.

## Online Programmes and Courses

## APAD Support Staff

Students in online programmes or courses should engage with the Academic Programming and Delivery  (APAD)  Division.  APAD  staff  members  are  available  to  support  students'  success through programme advising, management of course delivery, general academic support, etc. Support for students is available through the following roles:

## a) The Programme Manager

The Programme Manager (PM) provides academic guidance and support for the delivery of  courses  and  programmes. The PM's responsibility is to ensure that all courses and programmes are delivered in accordance with the University's regulations. The PM also gives general programme  advice,  and  serves as liaison between  the university administrators and students; monitors the performance of facilitators and participates in orientation activities with students.

Contact  information  for  Programme  Managers  can  be  found  on  the  programme information pages and Programme Advising documents on the Global Campus Website (See Appendix C), and in the Quicklinks block on the Student Portal.

## b)      Course Quality Assistant (CQA)

In  an  effort  to  better  support  students'  online  studies,  the  Global  Campus  utilizes  an Academic Support Team.  The aim of this team is to function as a sounding board on all issues impacting students' learning experience in our online learning environment.  The CQAs  complement  facilitators,  who  continue  to  be  students'  first  line  of  support  for academic studies.

Students  may  contact  the  CQA  assigned  to  their  course(s)  directly  via  email  (contact information  will  be  provided  in  the  Academic  Support  forum  at  the  beginning  of  the semester). The Academic Support Team may be contacted via email (academicsupport@open.uwi.edu) or Skype (Skype ID: uwioc\_academic\_support), Monday to Friday at 9:00 - 11:00 a.m. JA time/10:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m. EC time.

## c)  Learning Support Specialist (LSS)

To  support  students'  use  of  the  learning  technology  in  the  online  courses,  an  LSS  is assigned  to  each  course.  The  LSS  works  as  part  of  a  team  with  your  PM,  CQA,  and facilitators to provide you with an enriching learning experience.

You may contact the LSS assigned to your course by writing to helpdesk@open.uwi.edu

## Online Course Delivery - Teaching-Learning in the Learning Exchange (LE)

Global Campus students may interact with one or more of the following types of facilitators in our online classrooms based on their programme of study:

-  Course Instructors (CI)
-  Online Teaching Assistants (OTA)
-  Markers
-  Research Supervisors (RS)
-  Practicum Supervisors (PS)
-  Second Examiner (SE)

The CI is the course manager, lead instructor and academic facilitator for the course. He or she is responsible  for  customizing  the  course  and  managing  the  team  of  Markers  and  Supervisors assigned to the course (where applicable). In larger courses, the CI is supported by an OTA.

Students should view their facilitators as people who are there to facilitate their learning and assist them to succeed. Students should not be afraid to ask facilitators questions. Students who want to learn more about a specific concept or topic should feel free to ask their facilitator for guidance  to  source  additional  resources.  Students  who  are  struggling  with  a  concept  or  idea should  share  their  concerns  with  the  CI.  He  or  she  is  there  to  help  students  master  these concepts. Students are very strongly encouraged to engage with the CI and their peers in the various course forums and in live sessions.

## Course Issues

The students' first point of contact is Course Instructor for all matters affecting their successful completion of the course. We encourage students to reach out to their facilitators directly to share  concerns  during  live  sessions,  in  the  course  forums,  via  email,  and  via  the  Learning Exchange messaging system. When students post in forums (specifically the Facilitator-Student Exhange  forum)  it  helps  OPDD  support  staff  to  evaluate  the  quality  of  the  teaching-learning experience in the course and to provide support for students until the facilitator can be reached.

Note: Correspondence  between  students  and  facilitators  on  course-related  matters  must primarilty take place in the LE, or an approved UWI Global Campus technology source (e.g. GC email amd Zoom).

## Reporting a Problem

If  the  Course  Instructor  (CI)  is  unable  to  help  resolve  a  problem  that  is  reported  or  has  not responded to a request for help within 72 hours, students should seek the assistance of the CQA. Students may write to the CQA directly via email (contact information found in the Academic Support forum), or by way of the OPDD's Academic Support email academicsupport@open.uwi.edu. The team of CQAs will investigate the issue and liaise with the CI and other support staff as needed. The reference charts below outline the correct protocol for reporting various issues that students may encounter.

## Non-academic Requests or Problems

If  students  encounter  non-academic  problems  or  are  uncertain  about  whom  to  contact,  the following should be used as a guide:

## Communicating Online with Global Campus Personnel

Students  are  expected  to  send  emails  using  their  Global  Campus  email  address  and  include information  such  as  their  name,  student  ID  number,  course  name  and  course  code  in  their correspondence.  When  communicating  online,  students  are  asked  to  pay  attention  to  the following online protocol:

- 1. Always check to see if emails were correctly sent (i.e., not sitting in the draft box or it 'bounced'  back);  a  bounced  mail  sends  an  error  message,  indicating  the  address  is incorrect and not received by the intended party).
- 2. Check if the response indicates if the person is not available and follow the instructions provided in the automatic responder.

## Connecting As Students (CAS)

Students have the opportunity to engage each other not only within their courses but also across programmes through the forum Connecting As Students (CAS) space. CAS is The UWI Global Campus community forum space for all registered online students. The purpose of this space is to bridge the digital divide across all categories of students by giving students the opportunity to communicate with each other virtually to share ideas, to seek information from peers; to post questions and receive feedback; and to participate in general student-to-student engagement. Registered students, after gaining access to their courses, may access this CAS space by clicking the link found in their courses on the Learning Exchange.

## Libraries and Information Services

The Global Campus Libraries and Information Services (GCLIS) provides a distributed service to the  Global  Campus  and  The  UWI  community. In  addition  to  a  significant  and  growing  online collection, the GCLIS also holds print copies of books and journals at various Country Sites. Most of  the  libraries  at  the  Sites  function  as  reference  libraries  with  limited  circulation  under  the supervision of a Library Assistant. Other  Global Campus libraries offer an expanded range of services including full circulation services and  research  support. For  contact  and  other information about specific Global Campus Libraries, please visit https://www.open.uwi.edu/library/libraries

## Information Resources

Access  to  GCLIS  information  resources  is  via  UWI linC (The  University  of  the  West  Indies Libraries  Information  Connexion).  The  UWI linC portal  allows  users  to  search  and  access available  resources  from  the  catalogues  of  the  four  UWI  Campuses,  UWI  databases  and repositories,  subscribed  e-resources  (e-books,  e-journals  and  databases), and  selected  free  eresources. UWI linC may be accessed via the GCLIS website at https://open.uwi.edu/library/research/uwilinc or  through  the  Learning  Exchange.  Users  will be prompted to sign in with their myOC credentials to gain access to the full text of e-resources.

## Ask A Librarian

The GCLIS Ask A Librarian service is a virtual reference service that allows students to email or chat  live  online  with  GCLIS  staff.  The  Ask  A  Librarian  service  offers  research  assistance  and guidance on the use of library resources. The service is also available for general library queries and comments. To use chat , users must sign in with their myOC credentials. Alternatively, users may  send  a  question  or  comment  via  email.  No  sign  in  is  required  to  send  an  email.  For additional information on the Ask A Librarian service, please visit https://open.uwi.edu/library/research/ask-a-librarian

## Liaison Services
