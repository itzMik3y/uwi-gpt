## ACTING GLOBALLY

## UWI GLOBAL IS NOW A BRAND

I slands are generally expected to be culturally insular. Groups of islands, however, have always been global in their outlook and actions. Their grouping  has  tended  to  produce  a  culture  of the collective that yearns for connectivity beyond coastlines.

The University of the West Indies came into being as an academic world with an identity shaped by ethnic forces and historical circumstances that originate  in  places  far  beyond  its  boundaries. From its roots within the colonial ethos of London University  in  1948  it  has  yearned  for  fulfilment within a global ecology that challenged the constraints of its imperial birth.

Thinking  globally  while  being  connected  to regional roots has been the ideological heartbeat of  The  UWI  as  it  separated  from  its  colonial scaffold  in  1963.  From  that  moment  the  identity of the Caribbean as a crossroad of modernity has shaped  the  evolution  of  the  University.  While being  grounded  in  grassroots  sensibility  it  also looked  to  the  world  for  a  share  of  its  professors, programmes,  and  pedagogical  practice.  Its  best and finest students, administrators and professors have  been  women  and  men  who  saw  global academia as their business and as a benchmark.

To  stay  on  the  vine  is  also  to  risk  withering and dying on it.  To spread and plant new roots in  distant  soils  is  to  sustain  life  and  its  vitality. The UWI in its  current  strategic  cycle  has  done just  this.  Working  with  global  partners,  it  has reached out beyond the Caribbean into the wider world with a view to taking Caribbean excellence everywhere  while  exposing  its  inner  energy  of students  and  staff  to  global  engagement.  As  the world's first global village within the imperial age, the Caribbean and its UWI have transformed the terror of colonialism into the collegiality of culture and classroom conversations.

Beginning  with  the  setting  up  of  an  Office of  Global  Affairs  in  2016  in  order  to  prioritise programmes within the galloping culture of university globalism, we have called upon old allies and new friends to partner at an unprecedented level of trust and intimacy. No longer is it enough to foster the mobility of a few students and professors within  a  framework  of  collaboration.  The  new agenda  we  have  created  and  crafted  calls  for institution building and the establishment of joint centres and institutes for mutual advancement in the  areas  of  teaching,  research,  global  problemsolving and advocacy.

UWI Global, then, rises from the adversities of our history in order to facilitate a 21st century enlightenment that shines grace and humility upon the world of academia that is yet to fulfil its most honoured expectations.

Our  university  has  been  a  pioneer  in  this  regard.  Times  Higher Education says what we have done with our partners in just a few years, other universities have taken decades to achieve. With the support of the finest universities in the Americas, Asia, Africa, and Europe, The UWI has created a network of global academic activity that has forever changed its internal functions and the face its shows to the world.

UWI Global is now a brand. It is one of the world's most globalised universities.  It  has  done  so  upon  the  basis  of  decades  of  reaching  out beyond its beautiful shores. It required confidence, courage and creativity to deliver upon this agenda. Our students and professors are now more globally mobilised than ever before.

Now, we are preparing to leverage our internationalism in order to move the university into its online phase. UWI Online will be the ultimate fulfilment  of  a  dream  to  have  its  programmes  available  to  students globally. UWI Online is the beckoning academic agenda that rises upon the platform of our global presence.

In this publication we celebrate our global partners in Suzhou, China; New York, USA; St. Catharines, Canada; Coventry, UK; Lagos, Nigeria; Johannesburg, South Africa and Bogota, Colombia.

As we create a new global university ecosystem it will be recognised even more so that our role is to be both excellent and ethical as an institution dedicated to the betterment of humanity.

UWI Global,  then,  rises  from  the  adversities  of  our  history  in order  to  facilitate  a  21st  century  enlightenment  that  shines  grace and humility upon the world of academia that is yet to fulfil its most honoured expectations.

We have a role to play at home and beyond our shores. This requires the building of bridges over which our

worst  troubles  can  be  identified,  debated and  alleviated.  Future  generations  will hopefully sustain this path to progress.

UWI GONE GLOBAL

## Software and the SILK ROUTE

Y ou may have heard of the Silk Route, the ancient trade route between China and the West that first brought silk to  Europe.  A  Silk  Route  of  an entirely  different  kind  is  emerging  from  China's technology  and  software  sector,  part of that country's national effort to shift economic development  from  manufacturing  to  computeraided  innovation.  And  The  University  of  the West Indies is making connections with Chinese expertise through its recent partnership with the Global Institute of Software Engineering (GIST) in Suzhou, China.

GIST  is  a  Chinese  science  and  technology college  based  in  Suzhou  and  a  joint  venture between  GEM  Suzhou,  Microsoft  and  Suzhou Science and Technology Town. The city of Suzhou,  which  has  over  five  million  people,  is a  major  economic  centre  in  China's  southern Jiangsu province. It boasts the Suzhou Industrial

The UWI/GIST partnership has birthed the UWI-China Institute of Information Technology (UWICIIT), which in 2016 began offering a new four-year Bachelor of Science degree in Software Engineering  with  a  focus  on  mobile  application technologies. The UWICIIT head office is situated  within  the  historic  Mutual  Building  in Bridgetown,  Barbados,  which  has  recently  been renovated  and  outfitted  with  funding  from  the Chinese partners.

Caribbean students doing this novel software engineering programme spend the first two years at either The UWI's Cave Hill or Mona campuses and  then  continue  on  to  complete  their  final two  years  at  GIST  in  China.  It's  a  collaboration that  UWI  Vice-Chancellor,  Professor  Sir  Hilary Beckles has called 'a benchmark development in the internationalisation of The UWI. China is a key strategic partner for us as we seek to diversify and globalise the UWI experience.'

'We  have  had  relationships  with  hundreds of  universities  all  over  the  world  over  several decades,  but  this  is  the  first  occasion  that  The UWI  is  partnering  with  another  university  to establish  a  new  university',  said  Beckles  at  a press  conference  in  February  2016  to  announce the UWICIIT, adding: 'One of the largest nations of  the  world  has  now partnered with one of the smallest nations - this is truly significant!'

The  first  set  of  27  UWI  students  doing  the new  software  engineering  degree  programme began their studies in September 2016, the same year  that  China  officially  began  accepting  UWI degrees,  paving  the  way  for  deeper  CaribbeanChina  collaborations.  This  cohort  of  students, who are now in China, will earn double credentials-a bachelor's degree from The UWI and a diploma from GIST. They will soon move on to complete a six-month paid internship in the Suzhou Industrial Park before their return home to the Caribbean.

Providing a pathway for the Caribbean's tech leaders  of  tomorrow  is  the  start  of  an  exciting journey to engineer a much  needed digital revolution in our region.

## The SUNY-UWI Center

T he State University of New  York  (SUNY)  and  The University of the West Indies (The UWI) are collaborating in  a  unique  mission  to  tackle  some  of  the  world's  most pressing  problems  through  the  SUNY-UWI  Center  for Leadership and Sustainable Development.

Launched  in  2016,  the  Center  is  motivated  by  the  United Nations'  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs),  which  aim to  achieve  a  better  future  for  all  by  addressing  serious  global challenges of poverty, inequality, hunger, health, education, clean affordable energy, climate, environmental  degradation, sustainable  communities,  responsible  consumption  and  other pressing sustainable development issues.

Joint teams of UWI  and SUNY  experts will take a multidisciplinary approach to focus on five main goals: to create continuous  professional  education,  Bachelor's  programmes  and Master's programmes in leadership and sustainable development; to pursue solutions-oriented research; to engage and partner with other  organisations  and  the  community  in  advocacy  centred  on the attainment of the SDGs; to establish a network of experts to inform on the Center's work; and to develop a think tank.

With regard to the Center's education programmes, the first round  of  intake  for  the  Master's  Degree  is  scheduled  for  Fall 2019.  Meanwhile, on the research front, the Center has recently received  a  US$1.1  million  award  from  the  National  Institutes  of Health (NIH) Fogarty International Center for a five-year Global Infectious Diseases Research Training Programme. SUNY's campus at  Buffalo,  New  York,  will  lead  this  programme,  which will focus on a virology research programme and train 15 scientists including graduate students and post-doctoral fellows.

The first four of the 15 scientists involved in this programme are  based at The UWI - Dr Inshan Ali, a clinical microbiology resident; Chadwick Mears, a master's student in medical biology; Dr Michelle Brown, a specialist in epidemiology of viral hepatitis and treatment in Jamaica and Tiffany Butterfield, a PhD student in co morbidities in HIV infection.

An  Infectious  Diseases  Research  Center  is  a  high  priority for  the  SUNY-UWI  collaboration.  Enabling  Jamaica  to  become a regional hub, the research will focus on microbiologic, immunologic  and  pharmacologic  aspects  related  to  detection, epidemiology, diagnostics, treatment and prevention of infectious diseases. It will partner with programmes such as the Global Virus Network, WHO and Global Fund and network with the diabetes, digestive and liver disease and nanomedicine programmes.

At the Global Infectious Diseases Research Training Programme launch on November 2, 2018 at The UWI's Regional Headquarters  in  Jamaica,  SUNY  Chairman,  Carl  McCall  said: 'We're  trying  to  trace  infectious  diseases-how  they  start,  how they  get  transmitted  and  how  we  cure  them.  This  programme will enable medical researchers to discover new ways to trace and ameliorate the health outcomes of Caribbean populations.'

The  SUNY  UWI  Center  for  Leadership  and  Sustainable Development has its Secretariat based in New York at the Empire State  College's  building  on  Hudson  Street.  The  leadership  of the Centre is transitioning into a new team which includes new faculty and industry experts along with senior executives of both institutions.

## A freshly minted postgraduate Advanced

SUNY-UWI Certificate in Leadership for Sustainable Development should  be  open  to  students  by  the Fall semester, 2019. This programme emerges from the  international  partnership  of  The  University  of the  West  Indies  and  the  State  University  of  New York  in  the  SUNY-UWI  Center  for  Leadership  and Sustainable Development, an organisation launched in  2016  with  its  Secretariat  based  at  Empire  State College, New York.

The postgraduate certificate is the first programme  designed  under  a  Memorandum  of Understanding signed between The UWI and SUNY Empire  State  College  that  paves  the  way  for  dual award  degree  and  certificate  programmes  jointly developed  by  both  institutions.  With  coursework offered by both institutions for the programmes, the result will be separate awards from each university for the same curriculum.

The Advanced SUNY-UWI Certificate in Leadership  for  Sustainable  Development  will  help build the knowledge and skills base to achieve the

United Nations Sustainable Development  Goals within the Caribbean and New York State. Students will learn about  concepts  underlying  economic development and issues related to achieving sustainable development at community and national levels. The certificate aims to help recent graduates and  working  people  interested  in  working  in  the development field.

The five-course certificate will take one academic  year  and  include  online  and  distance learning methods. The UWI will be offering two of the courses: Concepts for Sustainable Development; and Ethics, Policy Formation and Governance. SUNY Empire State College will teach three courses:  Principles  of  Community  and  Economic Development; Leadership in Public and Non-Profit Organisations;  and  Stakeholder-sensitive  Business Models.

The  recent  approval  by  the  Department  of Education  in  New  York  State  of  this  new  joint postgraduate certificate is a major step and lays a foundation for future joint programmes and courses.

## Global Presence - New York, United States

The  UWI  and  SUNY recently  joined  hands  and hearts in a charitable initiative to rebuild a pre-school in hurricane ravaged Dominica. The project spearheaded by the SUNY-UWI Center for Leadership and Sustainable Development is the first initiative of this type undertaken by the Centre, reflecting the work which so closely aligns with  its  goal  of  facilitating  student  advocacy  toward sustainable development in the region.

Fourteen students; seven from The UWI  and seven from SUNY - New Paltz and a faculty member from each institution recently travelled to the island of Dominica to begin work, rebuilding the Morne Prosper Pre-School and restoring the attached Primary School from January 7 through 19.

Commenting on the project Dr Luz Longsworth, Pro Vice-Chancellor and Principal of The UWI Open Campus and Co-Chair of the SUNY-UWI Centre for Leadership and Sustainable Development said 'When we launched the SUNY-UWI Center in 2016, one of our stated goals was to encourage and facilitate student advocacy. We were so pleased to see the buy-in from our students; they  paid  their  own  way  to  and  from  Dominica  in  an

economic climate that is very challenging. At The UWI this says to us 'service to the region' is not just rhetoric but  is  a  living,  breathing  aspect  of  our  culture  that  is permeating one of our largest stakeholder groups - our students.'

Other  project  leaders,  Ms  Sally  Crimmins  Villela -  Associate  Vice  Chancellor  for  Global  Affairs,  SUNY and  Dr  Robert  Balkin  -  Director  of  Latin  America and  Caribbean  Collaboration,  SUNY  also  expressed satisfaction  with  the  level  of  participation  from  the students.

The SUNY UWI Center for Leadership and Development  was  formally  established  in  September 2016  with  the  aim  of  contributing  to  the  pool  of innovative solutions to specific problems that constrain  the  achievement  of  the  SDGs.  One  year later  in  September  2017,  the  island  of  Dominica  was devastated  by  Hurricane  Maria  which  damaged  90% of its structures. This presented an opportunity for The SUNY-UWI Center to deliver the kind of support it was set up to provide.

## SUNY, UWI Mona partner on Master's in Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering

A new collaborative programme that provides qualified  students  from  The  UWI  Mona, Jamaica an accelerated path to obtain a Master's of Electrical and Computer Engineering (MECE) degree from the State University of New York at Binghamton (SUNY-Binghamton), New York, USA is being developed.

This  follows  a  recent  five-year  Memorandum  of Agreement between the two institutions. The SUNYBinghamton  side  of  the  partnership  will  benefit  the Thomas J. Watson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, while The UWI Mona side of the partnership will  benefit  the  Mona  School  of  Engineering  (now Faculty of Engineering).

The  Master's  degree  will  involve  a  programme combining selected online courses and courses taken in  residency  on  the  Binghamton  University  campus. There  will  be  two  enrolment  options,  both  leading to  a  BS  degree  from  The  UWI  and  an  MS  degree from  Binghamton  University.  This  is a four-year programme, with the first two years of the Bachelor's study at The UWI Mona.

Thereafter, undergraduate students in Electronics Engineering  and  Computer  Systems  Engineering  at the  Mona  Campus,  who  have  completed  two  years with good standing, may in their third year enrol in a 60% online option at Binghamton University, taking one graduate-level course online per semester, while participating  in  a  year-long,  joint  UWI  Mona-SUNY Binghamton  senior  capstone  project.  In  their  final year, students will spend the Fall semester at SUNYBinghamton  and  return  to  Jamaica  for  their  final semester.

Another  option  allows  for  more  time  at  SUNYBinghamton, with a 10% online option at Binghamton University, and provisional enrolment at Binghamton in their third year Spring semester, followed by fulltime  enrolment  at  Binghamton  in  their  final  fourth year Fall and Spring semesters.

The collaboration aims to foster advancement and exchanges in teaching, research, workshops, academic collaboration and cultural understanding and to create  avenues  for  enhancing  learner  experience  at both universities.

R esponding to the economic growth needs of the  Caribbean,  The  University  of  the  West Indies  (The  UWI)  and  Coventry  University are working toward the creation of an Institute for Industry-Academic Partnership.

On  November  26,  2018,  a  team  from  Coventry University visited The UWI Mona Campus in Jamaica to meet  with  Professor  Sir  Hilary  Beckles,  ViceChancellor, and his team of Pro Vice-Chancellors, to flesh out the details and to design the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that will guide the creation and operations of the Institute.

On April 9, 2019, a team from The UWI led by Pro Vice-Chancellor  and  Principal  of  the  St.  Augustine Campus,  Professor  Brian  Copeland  and  including Professor  of  Practice,  Gerry  Brooks  visited  Coventry University to sign the MOU.

Recognising  Coventry  University's  elite  status in the  area  of  Industry-Academic  alliances,  ViceChancellor  Beckles  noted  that  'Coventry  has  much to share  with  The  UWI  in  this  regard,  and  will make  an  excellent  strategic  partner  in  the  effort  to facilitate how  The  UWI  can  better  contribute  to Caribbean entrepreneurship, industry innovation, and  professional  training  for  the  21st  century  global economy.'

The UWI  has  been driving the process to migrate university research into the private sector for commercialisation. The Institute will provide research training at the postgraduate levels, and will launch a suite  of  Master's  degrees  in  the  Caribbean  that  will facilitate bridge building with industry.

Noting  the  pressure  upon  the  university  sector in the  Caribbean  to  do  more  in  this  area  ViceChancellor  Beckles  stated,  'The  Caribbean  is  at  the innovate  stage  in  its  economic  development  where

value added in the economy must come from applied research  that  is  relevant  to economic diversification and  competitiveness.    The University is well positioned to  lead  in  this  area.    It's  an opportunity to rise and shine.  This partnership will go  a  long  way  in  assisting this process.'

## UNILAG-UWI Institute of African and Diaspora Studies

T he UWI is shrinking the space between Africa and the African diaspora in the Caribbean  through  collaborations in two African countries, Nigeria and South Africa.

In Nigeria, West Africa, The UWI is working with the University of Lagos (UNILAG) to develop the UNILAG-UWI  Institute of African and Diaspora  Studies.  The  initiative  that  began  in 2017, features an institute that is based at both the University of Lagos in southwestern Nigeria and at The UWI Mona campus in Kingston, Jamaica. It aims  to  advance  the  exchange  of  research, cultural  and  social  ideas  to  help  develop  Africa and the African Diaspora. Already, the Institute is offering a Master's degree in African and Global Studies.

'The UNILAG-UWI Institute will shrink the Atlantic Ocean into a very small river as we bridge the gap between Africa and the African Diaspora' said  The  UWI  Vice-Chancellor,  Professor  Sir Hilary  Beckles  at  the  signing  of  the  MOU  to establish the Institute.

## The Institute for Global African Affairs

M eanwhile, in South Africa, The UWI is  collaborating  with  the  University of Johannesburg in another new initiative. The  Institute for Global African  Affairs,  launched  in  November  2018  at The UWI Cave Hill Campus in Barbados, and in Johannesburg will offer a joint or double degree Master's programme in Global African Studies.

Joint  delivery  of  the  programme  will  take place in a mix of face-to-face and online formats. Plans are also in the works for an annual summer school module to be offered alternately between Barbados and South Africa.

According to The UWI  Vice-Chancellor Beckles,  'The  Caribbean  has  played  a  critical role in the defeat of apartheid and colonialism in South Africa, and other parts of Africa. In many respects,  the  diplomacy  of  CARICOM  and  the deploying of Cuban soldiers into Southern Africa were critical forces that secured the final liberation of the continent. It was an enormous Caribbean investment  in  intellectual  labour,  morality,  and life. Nelson Mandela made his first overseas visit to the region in celebration of this recognition. The 21st century will require the consolidation of these

## Canada-Caribbean STUDIES INSTITUTE

B rock University of Ontario, Canada and  The  UWI  are  now  in  discussions to create an Institute for CanadaCaribbean Studies to facilitate multidisciplinary research and teaching between the two institutions.

University representatives met  on  Brock's main campus in Niagara on Friday, April 5 to sign a new MOU to launch talks related to the proposed institute, and to renew two existing memoranda of  understanding  which  promote  international and  cultural  understanding,  academic  linkages and  continued  opportunities  for  faculty,  staff and  students  to  visit  each  other's  facilities  and collaborate on joint research.

The  UWI's  Vice-Chancellor,  Professor  Sir Hilary  Beckles  said  the  new  Canada-Caribbean Studies  Institute  would  'provide  a  focal  point for multi-disciplinary research and teaching to deepen and improve the multi-faceted relationships between Canada and the Caribbean and examine  issues affecting the Caribbean diaspora communities in Canada.'

The  UWI's  Pro  Vice-Chancellor  of  Global Affairs, Ambassador  Dr  Richard  Bernal  will serve as the principal officer to help facilitate the establishment of the institute working alongside Brock's Vice-Provost, Enrolment  Management and International, Dr James Mandigo.

Ambassador Bernal noted, 'Canada has been a very supportive partner for the Caribbean over  a  very  long  time  and  there  are  important investment,  trade  and  tourism  linkages.  This valuable  relationship  needs  to  be  reviewed  and refreshed  by  policy  based  on  multi-disciplinary research which is the purpose of the Institute for Canada-Caribbean Studies.'

This  most  recent  collaboration  builds  upon a rich  history  between  The  UWI  and  Brock University.

Brock  is  also  the  first  university  in  Canada to  be  led  by  a  Caribbean  descendant,  President Gervan Fearon, who is a Canadian of Jamaican ancestry.

Emphasising the significance, The UWI Vice-Chancellor, Professor Sir Hilary Beckles stated,  'This  was  an  initiative  which  I  placed before Brock's President Fearon when he visited our  Regional  Headquarters  last  year.  He  was very keen to think outside the box and bring his expertise  to  bear  on  creating  a  new  trajectory.' An economic historian, Vice-Chancellor Beckles also noted that 'Canada has been a most reliable supporter  of  Caribbean  nation  building'  and elaborated  further  that  'the  economic  history of  the  region  shows  the  centring  of  Canada  in Caribbean development.'

In an effort to provide academic and research leadership  to  this  relationship,  Vice-Chancellor

Beckles  proposed  that  an  'institution  be  created in order to establish the academic integrity of the relationship, and sustain the intimacy of the bond between  the  two  regions.' According  to  ViceChancellor  Beckles,  'Creative,  courageous,  and confident people build bridges and not walls, and the Canada-Caribbean bridge has been one of the most  productive  and  mutually  beneficial  relation constructed  in  the  last  hundred  years.  Working with  President  Fearon  and  his  team  at  Brock University, where I received an Honorary Doctorate a decade ago, will be rewarding and exhilarating. He is a brilliant economist with progressive pedagogical  roots  and  a  passion  for  development with  justice;  values  I  deeply  admire  in  academic leaders.  The  purpose  of  the  Institute  will  be  to provide joint academic degrees and conduct policy relevant  research  in  specific  Canada/Caribbean issues. It will serve  as a consortium  as  other Canadian universities are invited to participate in these activities. It will be one of the most relevant academic enterprises of the 21st century.'

## UWI-UNIANDES Alliance for Caribbean-Latin American Studies

A new regional collaboration embracing continental  Latin  America  and  the Caribbean  is  under  way.  Called  the Strategic Alliance for Hemispheric Development, the signing ceremony to launch this body was held on April 11, 2019 at the Universidad de los Andes (UNIANDES) in Bogota, Colombia.

According to Pro Vice-Chancellor and Principal  of  The  UWI  Open  Campus,  Dr  Luz Longsworth,  who  represented  The  UWI  at  the signing 'Through research-driven innovative solutions  to  regional  challenges,  this  Strategic Alliance between UNIANDES and The UWI will impact governance policies for economic growth, social  stability  and  sustainable  development  in the Caribbean and Latin America.'

There  are  already  joint  projects  in  medical sciences and comparative global cultural studies between The UWI and UNIANDES. The Strategic Alliance  for  Hemispheric  Development  builds on  a  history  of  regional  efforts  in  the  tertiary sector, including a 1968 conference of Caribbean university heads hosted by the University of Puerto Rico and in part financed by the Ford Foundation. That meeting led to the creation of the Association of Caribbean Universities and Research Institutes (ACURI), which elected its first Secretary General to be Sir Philip Sherlock, Vice-Chancellor of The UWI. Cooperative projects in health, agriculture, science and technology resulted from the ACURI body.

The April 2019 UWI  delegation to the Universidad  de  los  Andes  comprised  Dr.  Luz Longsworth, Dr Tomlin Paul, Dean of the Faculty of  Medicine  at  Mona  representing  The  UWI's three  Faculties  of  Medicine;  Dr.  Winston  De  La Haye, Deputy Dean, Faculty of Medical Sciences; Dr. Sonjah Stanley-Niaah, Director of the Institute for  Cultural  Studies  at  Mona;  and  Ambassador Gillian  Bristol,  Director  of  the  Latin  AmericanCaribbean Centre.

## The  Latin  American-Caribbean  Centre  (LACC)

is  a  university-wide initiative founded in 1993 with the endorsement of the  Rio  Group,  and  borne  out  of  the vision of a more integrated region, its mission is to build bridges  of  understanding  and  cooperation  between Latin America and Caribbean countries.

The  Centre's  activities  include  language  training programmes, exchange programmes, seminars on intra-regional migration and other topics, cultural events, and publications.  The UWI Colombia Student Exchange Programme has been an annual event since it began 2000. Hundreds of Caribbean and Colombian students and academic  staff have participated in summer programmes.

LACC  has been an active participant in the movement towards regional integration, with the support of countries from Latin America, the Caribbean, and  Spain.  LACC  has  facilitated  agreements  between The  UWI  and  many  other  institutions,  including  The Colombian Institute for Credit for Education and Technical Studies Overseas (ICETEX); the University of Panama; El Instituto Colombiano para la Promoción de la Educación Superior (ICFES); Unión de Universidades de  América  Latina  y  el  Caribe  (UDUAL);  Corporación Universitaria del Caribe (CECAR), Instituto de Formacion Tecnica  Profesional;  Universidad  Nacional,  Colombia; and the Ministry of National Education and Professional Training, Haiti.

Last November, the University of London celebrated The UWI's 70th anniversary with a special gala reception at the University of London's  William  Goodenough  College.  Hosted by  Professor  Peter  Kopelman,  Vice-Chancellor  of the  University  of  London,  in  association  with  The Rt. Hon. Baroness Patricia Scotland, Secretary General of the Commonwealth, the historic gathering  brought  together  the  leadership  of  the two  institutions  after  70  years  to  celebrate  their common  legacy.  Vice-Chancellor  Kopelman  spoke proudly of The UWI's achievements in public health and  community  medicine,  while  Baroness  Scotland said  she  looked  forward  to  the  continued  support of  The  UWI, especially in the area of climate smart studies and policies where the University has already demonstrated its expertise.

## 75 th ANNIVERSARY CAPITAL CAMPAIGN

While The UWI just marked its 70th anniversary last year, it is already  looking  ahead  to  its  75th anniversary  in 2023, with ambitious  plans for a Capital Campaign project focused on sport and youth development in the Caribbean. The UWI has retained the  services  of  Ms  Barbara  Stowe,  an  experienced fundraising consultant, with 40 years of fundraising operations  and  management  experience  in  major research universities, and a strong track record in capital campaigns, institutional strategy and international  programme  development  to  lead  this ambitious campaign.   As Vice President for Resource Development  at  MIT,  she  directed  a  comprehensive programme  of  private  financial  support  including oversight of a successful $2 billion capital campaign.

The UWI campaign aims to raise US$75  million for  the  Faculty  of  Sport  as  a  platform  for  education, training, scientific research and business development in sport and  sport-related disciplines, supporting new businesses in areas such as sports medicine and rehabilitation, sports management and sports tourism.

The campaign will promote future sporting excellence  through  its  programmes,  research  and world-class sports facilities at all four UWI campuses. And the campaign will harness the Faculty of Sport as  a  vehicle  to  promote  the  United  Nations  2030 development  agenda,  recognising  the  contributions of  sport  to  the  empowerment  of  women  and  young people,  individuals  and  communities,  as  well  as  to health, education and social inclusion.

This  75th  Anniversary  Capital  Campaign  will bring  together  people  across  the  Caribbean  region and  globally  to  mobilise  ideas,  talents,  projects  and funding,  and  to  celebrate  the  Caribbean's  vibrant history and culture of sporting excellence with the rest of the world.

## Sir Hilary Beckles

Please accept my sincerest congratulations on the 70th anniversary of The University of the West Indies. For seven decades, your prestigious institution has truly been A Light Rising From The West. And today, UWI is proudly the largest, most longstanding higher education provider in the Commonwealth Caribbean. America has benefitted from a long history of contributions by individuals of Caribbean descent, especially in government service. From the indomitable Shirley Chisholm, to Generals and appointees in the highest ranks of the Obama-Biden administration. Some of the brightest minds that I've ever had the privilege of working with in my career have come from Caribbean backgrounds: Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder's father was born in Barbados; Former U.S. Ambassador to South Africa Patrick Gaspard is of Haitian parentage; And both Former National Security Advisor Susan Rice and Former Secretary of State Colin Powell were born into families of Jamaican origins - the list goes on.

I am a firm believer in education. UWI understands, as I do, the importance of investing in the success of our young people. They will be the next great leaders of our world and have the power to improve the future for generations to come. Providing them with the best academics and resources possible enables them to achieve any dream that they set out for themselves. As you celebrate this wonderful and historic milestone, I hope that you can take a moment to appreciate how many young lives have been touched and how many improbable dreams have been realized in the past 70 years because of The University of the West Indies. For that, I cannot applaud UWI enough.

## EDUCATION WITHOUT BORDERS

N ot everyone who would like to expand  their  minds,  stimulate  their imaginations,  earn  useful  credentials or  improve  their  career  prospects  is able to attend a physical university. There may be family obligations, an existing job, limited funds, physical  disability  or  other  constraints  which may  make  a  conventional  university  education prohibitive, challenging or unlikely. But the liberating  world  of  online  learning  can  change that situation, opening doors to educational opportunities previously thought inaccessible.

The University of the West Indies has been  making  significant  advances  to  expand educational  access.  With  an  aim  to  fulfil  the University's goal of at least one University graduate in every Caribbean household, the new Office of Online Learning (OOL) under Regional Director,  Professor  Stafford  Griffith,  is  leading the development of online learning programmes across all four UWI campuses. Professor Griffith, who  was  appointed  in  October  2017,  holds  a Professorial Chair  in Research,  Measurement and Evaluation and is experienced in developing and delivering online courses, with an impressive track  record  of  public  service  and  educational innovations.

Meanwhile, The UWI Open Campus, under the  leadership  of  Dr  Luz  Longsworth  continues to open  doors  to  life-changing  opportunities. A  recent  partnership  between  The  UWI  Open Campus  and  the  Inter-American  Development Bank  (IDB)  is  also  set  to  bring  more  online learning  to  Caribbean  and  global  citizens.  It promises to vastly expand the volume and nature

A recent partnership between The UWI Open Campus and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) is also set to bring more online learning to Caribbean and global citizens.

of  educational  content  online  through  Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs).

The MOU, which was signed in August 2018, will enable better collaboration between  the two  entities  in  the  delivery  of  online  education. Currently, the IDB offers many highly rated online and face-to-face courses as well as open and free educational  resources.  Now,  the  way  is  open for  the  IDB  and  UWI  to  not  only  develop  their own joint MOOCs. Existing IDB courses may be translated from Spanish to English and adapted for Caribbean users. There are also opportunities for academic  credit  and  certification  of  IDB's MOOC programmes by The UWI.

According  to  the  data, there's a demand for  these  courses  in  the  Caribbean.  The  IDB's delivery platform, EdX, recorded an enrolment of more than 11,000 students in its MOOCs during 2014-2018, with online students from Trinidad and Tobago,  Guyana,  Jamaica,  Belize,  Barbados  and the Bahamas topping the participation.

Edgar  Gonzalez, IDB's Learning  and Knowledge Management Lead Specialist, says,  'MOOCs  are  positively  impacting  the academic, professional and social life of learners in Latin America and the Caribbean. In fact, MOOCs are generating benefits in the region, especially in less developed countries where access to formal education and information  and  communication  technology are more limited.'

While  the  Caribbean  can  benefit  from the  IDB's  bank  of  courses,  the  IDB  can  also help  disseminate  UWI  courses  to  the  world. Ms. Therese Turner-Jones, General Manager, IDB  Caribbean  Group  is  certain  that  this collaboration would not only serve to increase and leverage the knowledge created and disseminated  by  the  institutions  but  'also allow students worldwide to access these courses, learn more about the Caribbean and receive academic credit for it.'

## Ghana Medical students coming to UWI

I n October 2018, The UWI hosted a visit by the ViceChancellor  of  the  University  of  Ghana,  Professor Ebenezer Owusu,  to its Cave Hill Campus  in Barbados, during which the two universities renewed an MOU as a framework for collaboration in medicine and other areas. Emerging from this Cave Hill will soon be offering a three-year BSc Pre-Clinical Sciences degree in collaboration with the University of Ghana.

The final three clinical years of the medical degree programme will be at the University of Ghana. According to Pro Vice-Chancellor and Principal of The UWI Cave Hill Campus, Professor V. Eudine Barriteau, this means 'Ghanaian and other West African students can  complete  their  pre-clinical  medical  training  at Cave Hill Campus, gain a UWI degree and satisfy the requirements  for  fully  accredited  pre-clinical  medical training in Ghana. On their return to Ghana, they can seamlessly integrate into the clinical programmes of the University of Ghana:

A UWI degree will provide Ghanaian students with direct  entry  to  a  degree  programme  at  the  University of  Ghana once their Council approves the agreement.' Principal  Barriteau  went  on  to  call  it  a  'momentous development.'

## Embracing China

T he Confucius Institute (CI), named after Chinese  philosopher  K'ung  Futzu,  is  a  non-profit  public  educational organisation affiliated with the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China. It promotes Chinese language and culture, supports local Chinese teaching internationally, and facilitates  cultural  exchanges.  Its  programmes began  in  2004  and  it  now  has  more  than  500 offices  worldwide.  The  Confucius  Institute  has been  operating  directly  on  campuses  of  The University of the West Indies in Jamaica's Mona Campus  since  February  2009;  in  Trinidad  and Tobago's  St.  Augustine  Campus  since  October 2013;  and  in  Barbados'  Cave  Hill  Campus  since April 2015. It is an example of The UWI's embrace of strategic partnerships to encourage a globally oriented institution.

The CI-Mona teaches Mandarin and runs a Chinese resource library of books, films, cultural and  business  information.  Mona  Campus  will soon  get  an  exciting  new  Confucius  Institute, which is currently under construction. The new CI  building  at  the  Mona  Campus  will  include eight classrooms, a library, a lecture theatre and

a  cultural  exhibition  area.  The  CI-St.  Augustine teaches Mandarin  and  offers  HSK  Language Proficiency Examinations. HSK or Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi, is an official examination assessing  Chinese  language  proficiency  of  nonnative speakers from beginners to advanced level (levels 1-6). In 2018, the CI-St. Augustine attracted 661 students learning Mandarin in 77 classes.

The  CI-St.  Augustine  also  arranges  study tours  to  China  for  educators  and  students,  and runs popular community outreach activities through workshops, lectures, demonstrations and exhibitions in Tai Chi, Chinese calligraphy, Chinese  ink  blow  painting,  Beijing  opera  maskmaking, Chinese knot-making, Chinese teamaking, Chinese wine culture and Chinese cooking  classes.  Every  year,  it  hosts  a  popular Spring Festival Gala featuring dance, song, poetry recitals and martial arts demonstrations.

Meanwhile, in Barbados, the Prime Minister of Barbados, Mia Amor Mottley, has said by 2030, the  government  intends  that  every  Barbadian under 18 should be proficient in Mandarin. The CI-Cave  Hill  offers  YCT  or  the  Young  Chinese Test,  for primary  and  secondary  school  level

Chinese, as well as general courses in Chinese for business and travel. Since 2016, the CI-Cave Hill has  also  been  offering  HSK-certified  Mandarin proficiency courses at all six levels.

In another  initiative, the CI-Cave  Hill is helping  the  Caribbean  Examinations  Council (CXC) to develop curricula for certificates, namely the  CCSLC,  CSEC  and  CAPE  certifications  in Mandarin.  This  will  provide  access  to  courses leading  to  certification  in  Chinese  for  students aged 11-18 in 18 Caribbean territories.

In  a  language  initiative  at  tertiary  level,  the CI-Cave Hill has partnered with The UWI Cave Hill  Faculty  of  Humanities  and  Education  to develop a Minor in Chinese Studies, introduced in the 2018-2019 academic year. Cave Hill Campus is also working on ways to train regional teachers to  teach  Mandarin.  And  The  UWI  Cave  Hill School  of  Education  is  currently  collaborating with the Beijing Language and Culture University of  Chengdu,  China  to  develop  a  wide  range  of

new training programmes, including certificates in  translation,  creating  official  translators  who can work at conferences and regional and international meetings.

Less than three years after it was established, The  CI-Cave  Hill  in  December  2017  won  the prestigious Confucius Institute of the Year Award,  a  global  honour  given  by  the  Chinabased Hanban/Confucius Institute Headquarters which  oversees  500+  other  Confucius  Institutes worldwide.  In  receiving  the  award,  Pro  ViceChancellor and Principal of The UWI Cave Hill, Professor V. Eudine Barriteau said: 'It represents both recognition of the work the University and the  Institute  have  been  doing  together  and  an encouragement to achieve more. The relationship between the Caribbean and China is of growing importance and the Confucius Institute gives The UWI Cave  Hill  the  tools  to  equip  our  students with the language as well as the cultural means to shape this relationship.'

## Beckles UNESCO GLOBAL AFRICA History (GHA) Editor

U NESCO has embarked on the preparation and drafting of three new  volumes  of  the  Global  History of  Africa  (Volumes  IX,  X  and  XI).  It has  commissioned  distinguished  historian  and academic,  Professor  Sir  Hilary  Beckles  to  be Editor of Volume XI, entitled Global Africa Today. Professor  Beckles  was  also  an  editorial  team leader for Volumes IX and X.

The  beginnings  of  GHA  date  back  to  1964, when UNESCO launched the elaboration of the General History of Africa with a view to remedy the  general  ignorance  on  Africa's  history.  The challenge consisted of reconstructing Africa's history, freeing it from racial prejudices ensuing from slave trade and colonisation, and promoting an African perspective. UNESCO therefore called upon the utmost African and non-African experts. These experts' work represented 35

years  of  cooperation  between  more  than  230 historians and other specialists, and was overseen by  an  International  Scientific  Committee  which comprised two-thirds of Africans.

Described as a pioneering corpus, the GHA is unparalleled in its ambition to cover the history of the entire African continent, since the appearance human beings to contemporary challenges faced by Africans and their Diasporas in the world. It is a history that no longer leaves the pre-colonial period in the shadows and that deeply integrates the  destiny  of  Africa  into  that  of  humanity  by highlighting its relations with the other continents and  the  contribution  of  African  cultures  to  the general progress of humanity.

The earlier collection consists of eight volumes, all richly illustrated with maps, charts, figures and diagrams and a selection of black and white photographs.

## Some of The UWI's Global Icons &amp; Leaders

Long before a formal UWI Global Strategy was developed, The UWI has steadfastly built up a reputation for promoting its international intent and interests. For the last 70 years, globalisation has been in its institutional DNA, with pioneering women and men making their mark in the global landscape. A few of these leaders and icons are celebrated here.

## Professor The Honourable Ralston 'Rex' Nettleford, OM

Professor 'Rex' Nettleford was a Political Scientist and the first alumnus of The UWI to become Vice-Chancellor. He is credited with founding the Trade Union Education Institute which he also headed, in 1964 and it became a model institute for the Caribbean and wider world. Throughout his career he served as a consultant for virtually every Caribbean government as well as numerous international organisations, including CARICOM, the Organisation of American States, UNESCO, the International Labour Organisation, the World Bank, and the international Development Research Council, of which he was a founding director.

## Professor Elsa Goveia

Female pioneer, Elsa Goveia was the first Professor of West Indian history and the first woman (and perhaps the youngest) to hold a Chair in the University College of the West Indies (UCWI) when she was promoted in 1961. However, she made her mark internationally almost a decade earlier in 1952, when she was asked to contribute to a series on the historiographies of the Americas being produced by the Pan-American Institute of Geography and History. The result was her renowned publication of A Study on the Historiography of the British West Indies to the End of the Nineteenth Century.

## Ambassador Dr Lucille Mathurin Mair

Dr Lucille Mathurin Mair's legacy is her work as a distinguished Ambassador and a pioneer in the fields of history and women and gender studies. When she embarked on a PhD in history at The UWI, she made history by being the first person to do a dissertation based on women: 'A Historical Study of Women in Jamaica 1655-1844', which she completed in 1974. She was also renowned as an international diplomatic figure serving as Assistant Secretary-General in the office of the United Nations Secretariat in 1979. Following several other diplomatic roles, she also became the first woman to hold the title of UnderSecretary-General of the United Nations in 1982.

## Sir Arthur Lewis

Renowned Economist Sir W. Arthur Lewis was a Nobel Prize Laureate (1979) and former Vice-Chancellor of The UWI. He served as adviser on economic development to many international commissions as well as African, Asian, and Caribbean governments. He is credited with helping to establish the Caribbean Development Bank, and headed the institution from 1970-1973. In 1963 he was knighted for his contributions to Economics.

## Sir Alister McIntyre

Former academic and Vice-Chancellor of The UWI, Sir Alister McIntyre's regional and international public service assignments are too many to record. In 1974 he was appointed Secretary-General of CARICOM. He also held the positions of Director of the Commodities Division of UNCTAD and Deputy Secretary General, both in Geneva, Switzerland and was later transferred to New York to become Assistant Secretary-General in the Office of the Director General for International Economic Cooperation at the UN's Headquarters.

## Sir Shridath 'Sonny' Ramphal

In addition to his many esteemed roles in the Caribbean region, Sir Shridath 'Sonny' Ramphal, a distinguished jurist and former Chancellor of The UWI, (1989-2003) earned his reputation as an international public servant. Among his many accomplishments, Sir Shridath was conferred The Most Distinguished Order of Saint Michael and Saint George by Her Majesty the Queen of England in 1970 and in 1975 he was elected Secretary-General of the Commonwealth where he served for 15 years.

## Sir Derek Walcott

West Indian poet and playwright Sir Derek Walcott was an alumnus of The UWI Mona Campus, and was also awarded an honorary DLitt in 1973. His literary works are known and lauded internationally and earned him the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1992. That year he was also among the first recipients of the Community's highest award, the Order of the Caribbean Community. He was also highly decorated with national and international honours, most notably Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1972; and Knight Commander of the Order of Saint Lucia in 2016.

## Marlon James

Marlon James is an internationally celebrated alumnus of The UWI and recipient of the 2015 Man Booker Prize for Fiction for his book A Brief History of Seven Killings. He has the distinction of being the first Jamaican and the second overall Caribbean national to be awarded the coveted prize. His publication explores through several characters, the events surrounding the attempted assassination of Bob Marley and the ensuing aftermath.

## Lorna Goodison

Honorary Graduate, Lorna Goodison is lauded as one of the Caribbean's finest poets, focusing much of her poems on women and their struggles. Her 1986 published volume of works, I Am Becoming My Mother, was widely recognised both regionally and internationally, earning her the Commonwealth Writers' Prize the following year.

## Digital Transformation for Global Engagement

J ust like the Caribbean itself, The University of the West Indies has evolved  into  different  collectives,  units and  sub-units,  each  with  its  own  ways of doing things. To foster better unity, flexibility and  efficiency,  there  have  long  been  plans  to modernise,  reconceive  and  expand,  change  or adjust the university's digital systems.

Earlier conceptions of creating a Single Virtual  University  Space  (SVUS)  in  2008  have today morphed into the idea of a digital platform system  that  enables  good  communication  and flexible outreach and collaboration. Today, 'Digital Transformation' at The  UWI  is  about enabling  and  transforming  university  relations and communications for better experiences and outcomes. It is about making business and  education  easier  to  do  across  many  units, campuses,  and  different types and  scales of activities,  both  internally  (within  the  university) and  externally  (in  joint  offerings,  programmes and services).

A  better,  more  flexible,  standardised  digital platform  across  all  campuses  and  access  points can  help  The  UWI  reach  out  to  more  people who are geographically scattered across different islands  and  countries.  A  better  digital  platform can be a medium  for  more  creative, varied multimedia  learning  tools  and  online  learning experiences. It can help reduce education costs  through  online  programmes,  becoming  a powerful tool in mass education and self-directed learning.  It  can  increase  the  local  relevance  of education and training to better meet the needs of specific communities of learners. A better digital platform  can  also  help  build  a  more  connected, vibrant community of scholars in the Caribbean by  creating  shared  virtual  working  spaces  and spaces for knowledge exchange.

## it is a task which The UWI sees as essential to fulfil its mission to be a more responsive, locally relevant and globally engaged institution.

The  UWI's  Digital  Transformation  mission envisages  all  these  things.  It  is  essentially  an approach  to  using  digital  technology  systems to enable better cross-campus relationships, collaborations and communications, so that all of the goals of UWI's Triple A Strategic Plan (20172022) may be realised.  This plan has a 'One UWI' vision and sees The UWI as a unified Caribbean activist  university  with  both  local  and  global relevance, to serve everyone in the region.

What will a new and improved digital technology system actually involve? A ' One UWI digital transformation platform' focuses on three tracks for the digital technology project:

## · ACADEMIC

(involving programming, courseware digitisation and library resource distribution);

## · TECHNOLOGY

(involving data architecture, software &amp; content management,  and hardware and networks connectivity); and

## · BUSINESS

(involving  management  of  students,  human resources and finances).

According to Pro Vice-Chancellor and Principal of The UWI St. Augustine Campus, Professor Brian Copeland, who anchors this exercise as Chair of the Steering Committee, 'implementing a new digital system is a lot of work, involving wide consultation, much research and many stages along the way. But it is a task which The UWI sees as essential to fulfil its mission to be a more responsive, locally relevant and globally engaged institution.'

## UWItv taking Caribbean content to the World

U WItv is  the  public  information  and education  service  of  The  University of  the  West  Indies.  It  is  just  over  two years old, offering a mix of university news,  reports  on  research  projects,  interviews, feature  stories,  recorded  speeches  from  events, and occasional live-streaming coverage of events. Launched in December 2016, the fledgling service aims to be a socially conscious, issue-driven outlet as well as a tool for public outreach, education and quality information.

UWItv  content  is  broadcast  daily  in  threehour segments on CaribVision, a Barbados-based division  of  the  Caribbean  Media  Corporation. Its other  partner  is  the  RJR  Communications Group  in  Jamaica.  So  the  channel  reflects  a successful  partnership  between  academia  and the  media  industry.  UWItv  also  has  a  website (www.uwitv.org) with a searchable database, from  which  viewers  can  access  free  universityrelated  video  content  on  demand.  Social  media

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

channels (Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Flickr and Instagram) complement the online and cable channels.  Through  these  many  media,  content reaches millions of viewers in the Caribbean and beyond.

UWItv currently produces four regular shows: Region Talk (UWI-led conversations on  regional  issues),  Pelican  Pride  (community features, alumni  stories,  and  campus  events), Research  Room  (where  researchers,  innovators and thinkers share their findings) and Generation Nexx (features on student life).

A  sampling  of  online  videos  from  this  year reveals an eclectic variety of content. For example, there's  a  'Fire  in  Babylon'  panel  discussion  on cricket  as  popular  culture;  a  literary  lecture  by Kelly  Baker  Joseph  on  'Brathwaitian  Models  of Engagement:  Inna  De  Digital  Yard';  recordings of live-streamed University Council business meetings;  and  the  book  launch  of  'My  Political Journey' written by former Jamaican prime minister  PJ  Patterson.  You  can  also  find  video footage  from  the  'Break  the  Silence:  Educators and Child Sexual Abuse Symposium' held at the St. Augustine Campus; a full documentary called 'Sun, Sea and Science' about Trinidad's addiction to oil and the need for diversification; and many other offerings.

Whether the topic is the impending impacts of  climate  change,  historical  reflections  on  the postwar  Windrush  generation,  or  findings  from the  latest  UWI  medical  research,  UWItv  helps share  a  cross-section  of  academic  interests  and ideas.

UWItv  also runs occasional features on student life, such as profile interviews with students sharing their experiences, or video footage of larger student events such as last year's Postgraduate Intercampus Debating competition at Cave Hill Campus in Barbados.

As  UWItv  continues  to  evolve,  it  remains a media resource for UWI-driven advocacy, research, information, education, and civic debate on  issues  affecting  campus  and  Caribbean  life. UWItv  is  expanding  the  UWI's  reach  beyond Caribbean  borders  to  promote  and  teach  about Caribbean  thought  and  engage  with  the  wider world.

Managing Director of the RJR Communication Group, Jamaica, Mr Gary Allen delivers the keynote address at UWItv's anniversary event.

## IAU selects UWI to lead Climate Smart Research and Advocacy

T he world's first climate smart  study institute, offering degrees and certificates at all levels in climate-related studies could be born out of The UWI. This, according to Vice-Chancellor, Professor Sir Hilary Beckles.

It  comes  on  the  heels  of  the  International Association of Universities' (IAU's) notable selection of The UWI, in February 2019, to lead the  world  in  mobilising  climate-smart  research and  advocacy.  The  IAU,  an  affiliate  body  and higher education think tank for the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation  (UNESCO),  selected  The  UWI  for this  task  because  of  the  University's  decadeslong track record of excellent research on climate change  and  sustainable  development,  including climate modelling, environmental protection, marine ecosystems, disaster risk reduction and  resilience, through  diverse faculties and specialized research centres such as the Institute for Sustainable Development, Centre for Disaster Risk Reduction, Centre for Resource Management and Environmental Studies (CERMES) and Seismic  Research  Centre.    It  is  one  example  of UWI research driving scientific knowledge, policy and advocacy on the global stage.

The Caribbean is one of the world's most vulnerable regions to climate change. Climate change threatens our lifestyle, our livelihoods, and our very lives.

L-R: Dr Hilligje van't Land, Secretary General of the IAU, Professor Pam Fredmam, President of the IAU and Vice-Chancellor of The UWI, Professor Sir Hilary Beckles at UNESCO's Headquarters on January 30, 2019.

The United Nations' (UN's) Sustainable Development Goal #13  (SDG  13)  calls  for  urgent action to combat the serious impacts of a changing climate, which include changing weather patterns, rising sea levels, destruction of marine ecosystems  due  to  warmer,  more  acidic  oceans, and extreme weather events such as hurricanes, floods, prolonged  droughts  and  wildfires.  All of these  disrupt  human  food  supplies,  wreak havoc with agriculture, housing settlements and economies, and threaten life.

As the leader of the SDG 13 (Climate Action) Global Cluster on Higher Education and Research for Sustainable Development (HESD), The UWI will  work  with  universities  across  the  globe  on projects  that  harness  research,  innovation  and their application to promote social and economic growth with a balanced focus on people, planet and  prosperity.      Other  members  of  the  SDG 13 cluster are currently being finalised; the University  of  the  South  Pacific,  University  of Witwatersrand,  University  of  Bristol,  University of  Bergen,  University  of  Ghana,  University  of Waterloo and SUNY, among others.

## 1.5 TO STAY ALIVE

In a report  released  on  October  8,  2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which includes more than 1,300  international  scientists,  forecasted  a  likely temperature rise of 1.5°C between 2030 and 2052 if  things continue to heat up at the current rate. Such a rise would have severe impacts on all small island states such as the Caribbean islands.

Professor Michael Taylor, Dean of the Faculty of  Science  and  Technology  at  The  UWI  Mona Campus, was one of the coordinating, lead authors of that IPCC 1.5 Report, and commented after  its  release:  'Caribbean  scientists  have  long held  the  position  that  (global  temperature  rise of) 1.5°C may be the limit of global warming that vulnerable regions such as ours can tolerate.'

There  is now  a  global campaign  calling on  world  leaders  to  limit  global  warming  to  1.5 degrees in order to prevent the catastrophic effects of climate change.

Speaking  on  The  UWI's  contributions  to  the IPCC  1.5  report  in  October  2018,  Vice-Chancellor Beckles  said:  'This  kind  of  work  reaffirms  the relevance of The UWI to the region as an activist university. The climate change discourse will reveal

the need for this region to address the fundamental issues: economic growth, technological advancements,  inequality,  democracy  and  social justice. All of those big issues come into the fore of the climate change issue.'

Later,  in  an  address  to  the  IAU  in  January 2019  at  UNESCO's  headquarters  in  Paris,  France, he emphasised further: 'The UWI's scientists recognised decades ago that climate change, rising sea levels and ocean temperatures were an existential threat to the Caribbean, small island states, and the world, and to this end provided a body of scientific knowledge to prove and promote the case.'

The UWI's Climate Change Research Cluster is currently led by Professors John Agard, Michael Taylor  and  David  Smith.  Many  UWI  scientists have  served  as  contributing  authors  to  IPCC reports on climate change over the years. In 2007, UWI Professors Anthony Chen, Leonard Nurse and John Agard shared in the glory of the Nobel Peace Prize which was given jointly to the IPCC and Al Gore Jr for work done to create and spread better knowledge about man-made climate change  and  lay  the  foundations  for  mitigating measures to counteract such change.

## A RACE AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS

O n August 9, 2018 The UWI  was the venue  host for the launch  of the Caribbean Climate-Smart Accelerator, a ground-breaking initiative to support the Caribbean becoming the world's first 'climate-smart zone'.

Through an unprecedented coalition including  27  countries  and  over  40  private  and public partnerships, the Caribbean ClimateSmart  Accelerator  seeks  to  build  more  resilient countries, cities and  industries, and  stronger infrastructure  that  can  withstand  the  effects  of climate disaster. Climate solutions for renewable energy, development of sustainable cities, oceans and transportation are all part of the plan. The Accelerator initiative will work to fast-track sound public and private investment opportunities which support climate action and economic growth through sustainable development.

The  Accelerator's  specific  areas  of  focus  are threefold:  Disaster  preparedness,  recovery  and resilience; investing in low carbon development; and  breaking  down  barriers  to  climate-smart growth.

President  of  the  IDB  Luis  Alberto  Moreno and  Founder  of  the  Virgin  Group  Sir  Richard Branson led the launch, while the Prime Minister

of  Jamaica,  Andrew  Holness,  gave  the  feature address.  Speakers  also  included  world  record sprinter  Usain  Bolt,  Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs and  Foreign  Trade  in  Jamaica  Kamina  Johnson Smith,  and  President  of  the  World  Bank  Jorge Calderon. Bolt, Jamaica's eight-time Olympic Gold Medal  winner,  and  internationally acclaimed dancehall artiste, Sean Paul, were both appointed Accelerator Ambassadors, to promote the work of the Accelerator to support climate-smart action in the  region.    Bolt  also  launched  the  Accelerator's $50,000 'Speed  Award' that  recognizes  leading countries,  businesses  and  individuals  working towards a climate-smart zone.

The  UWI's  Vice-Chancellor,  Professor  Sir Hilary Beckles in his remarks, reminded attendees of The UWI's longstanding commitment to

research and investigation of natural phenomena and environmental-related studies. 'As early as  1957,  we  established  the  Centre  for  Seismic Research in Trinidad. In 1986, we established the Centre  for  Marine  and  Environmental  Studies at  our  Cave  Hill  Campus  in  Barbados.  In  2006, we established the Institute for Sustainable Development here on the Mona Campus, constituting collectively a rich praxis of research,

teaching and activism that has laid the pathway and  the  policy  framework  for  the  arrival  of  the Accelerator.'

President  Moreno  committed  the  $1  billion in funds that IDB pledged at President Macron's December  2017  Paris  One  Planet  summit  and added a further $3 million as start-up funds to the Accelerator  to  help  get  this  important  initiative successfully up and running.

## SMALL ISLANDS of the World Unite

T he  leaders  of  eight  island  colleges  and universities made several collective commitments toward sustainability on  April  9,  2019  during  a  presidential summit prior to the start of the 10th University of Guam Conference on Island Sustainability at the Hyatt Regency Guam. The University of the West Indies was among the group, which also included the presidents from the University of Guam, Guam Community College, Northern Marianas College, the College of the Marshall Islands, the University of Hawaii,  Western  Philippines  University  in Palawan,  and  Jeju  National  University  in  South Korea.

Universities were not built for themselves - they were built for their communities. We are islands apart, but we are all in this together.

'All  of  our  universities  are  uniquely  wellsuited  to  help  society  figure  out  how  to  meet the challenges  that  we're facing in terms  of sustainability,'  said  Thomas  W.  Krise,  president of UOG.

The university heads shared with one another the specific initiatives underway  on their  campuses  to  address  sustainability  issues -including renewable energy, rainwater catchment, and transportation projects - as well as  the  challenges  in  island  sustainability  that they continue to face, including waste reduction and  food  security.  They  then  agreed  upon  the list of commitments  in  terms  of  educational programming and university activity, i.e.:

- · Seek indigenous/island solutions to island problems
- · Connect heads of research with one another
- · Connect heads of workforce development with one another
- · Create  an  inventory  or  website  to  connect  best practices or solutions
- · Exchange visits among institutions to foster future exchanges of faculty, staff, and students

In his remarks, Pro Vice-Chancellor and Principal of  The  UWI  Mona  Campus,  Professor  Dale  Webber reminded that 'Universities were not built for themselves - they were built for their communities.' He continued, 'We are islands apart, but we are all in this together.'

## UWI launches Global Tourism Resilience Centre

T wo separate tourism-related initiatives - one about the business of tourism and the other about managing the risks affecting tourism - are in progress, involving links with The University of the West Indies Mona Campus in Jamaica.

The UWI should have its first Graduate School of Tourism open for business by early 2020. It will be located at the new UWI Western Jamaica Campus at Barnett Oval in Montego Bay, the heart of the tourism belt in Jamaica. UWI Mona Campus Principal Professor Dale Webber said the school will serve to complement the other tourism training institutions in  western Jamaica that currently provide undergraduate studies and will serve as feeders to The UWI's postgraduate programmes.

Meanwhile, a Global Tourism Resilience and Crisis Management Centre was launched by the Government of Jamaica in a ceremony at the Montego Bay Convention Centre in Rose Hall, St James on January 20 of this year. The centre, to be located on the UWI Mona Campus in Kingston, will work to assess, forecast, mitigate and manage a range of  risks  affecting  the  tourism  sector.  These  risks  may  include  natural disasters  such  as  earthquakes,  hurricanes  and  tsunamis;  cybercrime; pandemics; terrorism; war and changing funding models. The centre is expected to be operating from September 2019.

<!-- image -->

First  announced  during  the  United  Nations World Tourism Organisation Global Conference on Sustainable Tourism in Montego Bay, Jamaica in November 2017, the centre will be tasked with creating, producing and generating toolkits, guidelines  and  policies  to  handle  the  recovery process  following  a  disaster. The  centre  will also  assist  with  preparedness,  management  and recovery  from  disruptions  or  crises  that  impact tourism and threaten economies and livelihoods.

Jamaica's Minister of Tourism, Edmund Bartlett,  has  said  that  several  universities  have expressed  an  interest  in  the  centre,  with  plans of forging partnerships. They include The University of the West Indies; Queensland University,  Australia;  Hong  Kong  Polytechnic; Bournemouth  University,  United  Kingdom;  and George Washington University, United States of America.

Gordon 'Butch' Stewart, Chairman and Founder, Sandals Resorts with The UWI Vice-Chancellor, Professor Sir Hilary Beckles

He  added  that  partnerships  are  also  being explored  with  Harvard  University;  University of Waikato, New Zealand; University of Southhampton;  Boston  University,  the  United States of America and the International University of  Japan,  to  look  at  global  projects  relating  to tourism resilience and climate change.

Major partners in the centre include the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO); the World  Travel and  Tourism  Council; the Caribbean Hotel and Tourism Association; the  Caribbean  Tourism  Organisation;  and  the Jamaica  Hotel  and  Tourist  Association  (JHTA), according to JIS.

Assistant Secretary General of the Organisation  of  American  States  (OAS),  Nestor Mendez, has said establishment of the Centre is not only vital but also 'very timely.'

'It is of particular significance that the Centre is  being  established  here  in  the  Caribbean,  as the Caribbean tourism sector is often the victim of Atlantic hurricanes, which invariably leads to temporary and permanent closure of hotels and ancillary businesses,' Mendez said at the launch event in January.

He  said  the  OAS  has  long  recognised,  with grave  concern,  that  the Latin American  and Caribbean  region  represents  one  of  the  most vulnerable regions in the world due to the adverse impact of climate change.

'For the OAS, the issue of resilience remains a  critical  one.  The  organisation  has  played  an integral  role  in  supporting  efforts  to  enhance resilience in the tourism sector in the Caribbean for many years,' Mendez noted.

## UWI's global impact on SDGs

LEAVING NO ONE BEHIND

I n  2017,  the  Sir  Arthur  Lewis  Institute  for Social and Economic Studies (SALISES) based  at  The  UWI  Mona  Campus,  Jamaica, was contracted by the United Nations Development  Programme  (UNDP),  on  behalf of  the  Government  of  Jamaica,  to  prepare  the country's  first  Sustainable  Development  Goals (SDGs) Country Report.

The Sustainable Development Goals provide a pathway towards achieving a more sustainable future, and targets for the world we would like to have  by  2030.    The  Global  Goals  aim  to  ensure that the most vulnerable are considered, and no one is left behind.

To undertake this assignment, SALISES formed  a  multi-disciplinary  team  led  by  Prof. Aldrie Henry-Lee and Dr. Arlene Bailey -Principal and  Co-Principal  Investigators. The team produced four research reports or outcomes:

- · The Sustainable Development Goals Report,  which  focused  on  key  Sustainable Development  Goals:  SDG  6,  Clean  Water and Sanitation; SDG 7, Affordable and Clean  Energy;  SDG  11,  Sustainable  Cities and Communities; SDG 12, Sustainable Consumption  and  Production;  SDG  15,  Life on  Land;    and  SDG  17,  Partnerships  for  the Goals.
- · Statistical Annex
- · Report  on  country  efforts  towards  'Leaving No One Behind' and including Jamaica's most vulnerable in the development processes
- · Communications and Advocacy Plan for the SDGs.

The  report assessed some  key  indicators for  those  people  considered  vulnerable  and  at risk, assessing indicators of the national poverty rate,  the  national  child  poverty  rate,  the  youth unemployment rate and the poverty rate in rural areas. The team met with many stakeholders and held community consultations to do the study.

The  study  highlighted  some  of  the  good practices for which Jamaica has been recognised; lessons learned in mainstreaming and localising the SDGs and accelerating implementation; challenges which may be faced during the implementation process; areas for capacity building  in  monitoring  and  reporting  on  the SDGs; and related areas where additional support may be useful.

Elements  of  the  four  reports  prepared  were used to inform the preparation of Jamaica's first Voluntary  National  Review  on  the  Sustainable Development  Goals,  presented  at  the  United Nations  High-Level  Political  Forum  2018  (UN HLPF 2018) which took place July 9-18, 2018 at UN Headquarters in  New  York.  The  SALISES  team formed  part  of  the  Jamaican  delegation  to  the HLPF, presenting the report on 'Leaving No One Behind' on behalf of Jamaica.

The project should contribute to planning and policy  processes  of  the  Government  of  Jamaica and play a role in advancing the strategic vision of Jamaica by 2030.

## ACTIVISM in Social and Reparatory Justice

A very moving dance from The Crossing, originally choreographed by the late Professor The Honourable Rex  Nettleford,  opened  the  formal launch  of  the  Centre  for  Reparations  Research (CRR)  on  October  10,  2017.  Performed  by  the National  Dance  Theatre  Company  of  Jamaica, the  dance  conveyed  through  music  and  motion a poignant sense of suffering and loss, as well as qualities  of  endurance  and  the  spiritual  resolve of African peoples brought to the Caribbean and enslaved. With this symbolic dance, the Centre for Reparations Research was launched in Kingston, Jamaica at The UWI Mona Campus.

The Centre is an activist collective which aims to  build  awareness  and  do  necessary  research to  advance  the  claim  for  reparation  for  some  of the  brutalities  of  our  violent  history:  Europeanimposed genocide of Indigenous Peoples, African

enslavement, deceptive indenture, and the negative and continuing legacies of a pernicious colonialism  which  deliberately  underdeveloped and  divided  the  Caribbean  in  ways  that  have ripple effects to this day.

UWI Vice-Chancellor Professor Hilary Beckles  says  the  Slavery  Abolition  Act  of  1833, which required the payment of £20 million to slave owners  in  compensation  for  loss  of  'property', left  formerly enslaved people landless, homeless and  uncompensated,  setting  future  generations and emerging societies such as the Caribbean at a significant economic and social loss. Therefore the  Centre  for  Reparations  Research  is  leading the advocacy efforts for CARICOM's Reparatory Justice programme. Professor Beckles is Chair of the CARICOM Reparation Commission.

In  addition  to  its  advocacy,  the  Centre  for Reparations Research is leading an educational

US civil rights leader, the Rev Jesse Jackson and US actor Danny Glover, with whom Vice-Chancellor of The UWI, Professor Sir Hilary Beckles met as key US-based supporters of the global reparations movement.

work agenda to teach new generations of young people in schools and at the University about the legacies of genocide, enslavement, indenture and colonialism, and the need for justice and repair.

Professor  Verene  Shepherd  is  the  Director of  the  CRR.  Its  creation  is  a  direct  response  to CARICOM's  mandate  to  The  UWI  at  the  34th Meeting of Heads of Government in July 2013 to collaborate with other Caribbean universities to establish  the  research  institute  as  a  vehicle  for research and public advocacy.

The CARICOM  Reparation Commission, established in 2013, has put forward a Ten-Point Action Plan to European  countries formerly involved in slavery and exploitation of the Caribbean. Features of the plan are: a full formal apology  from  European  governments; repatriation for those who desire it; an indigenous peoples'  development  programme;  the  building of cultural institutions; tackling chronic diseases such as hypertension and type two diabetes; the eradication  of  illiteracy;  an  African  knowledge programme; psychological rehabilitation; technological  transfer  and  science  sharing;  and the cancellation of debt.

Today, there are national reparations committees  in  many  Caribbean  islands  as  the cause gains momentum.

The idea of reparations is not ancient history. A loan that was taken by the British Government to  pay  slave  owners  for  the  abolition  of  slavery in 1834 was not fully repaid until 2015. Professor Beckles shared this information at a press conference in February 2018 at the CRR, noting it meant that for 180 years, British citizens had been repaying the slavery abolition loan, which made it a present-day issue.

## HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISM at The UWI

T he  University  of  the  West  Indies  St. Augustine Campus is championing human rights advocacy through a range of  initiatives.  Among  them,  a  series  of highly International Human Rights Clinic sessions run by The UWI St. Augustine's Faculty of Law, led by Professor Rose-Marie Belle Antoine, Dean of the Law Faculty; and a research project on child rights involving many partners from Canada and Central America, led by Dr. Godfrey St. Bernard, Senior Fellow at the Sir Arthur Lewis Institute of Social and Economic Studies (SALISES).

## HUMAN RIGHTS CLINIC

The  Faculty  of  Law's  International  Human Rights  Clinic  (IHRC)  is  an  innovative  education tool which engages human rights in accessible and activist  ways,  aligning  with  non-governmental organisations, legal practitioners, the state sector, international  organisations  and  other  strategic partners.  It  accompanies  the  LLB  International Human  Rights  Clinic  Course  and  is  funded  by the Ministry of Education through the European Development Fund.

This year students worked on Persons Deprived of Liberty (including Remand and  Refugees).  Currently  there  are  few  legal professionals  that  have  sufficient  knowledge  of international  human  rights  and  refugee  law  to provide competent representation. Here the IHRC can help, in partnership with others, to support the  new  responsibility  of  the  Government  of Trinidad and Tobago to advance its priorities in migration management while addressing refugee and migrant rights.

The Clinic has been accepted as an institution for the purposes of presenting before international hearings on human  rights violations at the Inter-American  Commission  on  Human  Rights, Washington, DC  and  is currently preparing submissions  for  a  hearing  on  Refugees  in  the Caribbean.

## RIGHTS OF CHILDREN AND YOUTH PARTNERSHIP

In  another  human  rights  project,  this  time under  the  Sir  Arthur  Lewis  Institute  of  Social and  Economic  Studies  (SALISES)  at  The  UWI St.  Augustine,  children  and  youth  are  receiving central focus. The  project,  entitled Rights  of Children and Youth Partnership - Strengthening Collaboration in the Americas (RCYP) has received CDN  $4.2 million from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) of Canada for the period 2015-2021.

The project, based in Canada, Central America and the Caribbean, aims to understand the social, political,  economic  and  social  protection  factors that  contribute  to  violence  against  children  and youth  in  the  three  regions.  It  will  also  advise policy-makers and service providers on effective strategies for youth  safety, and  contribute  to evidence-based policies and practices that respond to violence against children and youth.

Sites for the studies are Canada, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Honduras, Dominican Republic, Trinidad and Tobago, and Jamaica.

## SPORTS LAW WORKSHOP: APRIL 12, 2018

This workshop featured distinguished international  and  local  speakers  and  raised  issues of the (mis)management of Caribbean sports, notably  cricket;  corruption  in  sports;  the  need  for accountability  in  the  big  business  of  sports  which earns much revenue with little local oversight; and the work of the Court of Arbitration for Sport which is based  in Lausanne, Switzerland. Among  the presenters were eminent international British sports lawyer, author and lecturer Professor Ian Blackshaw; former  West  Indies  wicketkeeper/batsman  Deryck Murray; Dr. Jason Haynes who is senior Legal Officer of  the  British  High  Commission  in  Barbados;  Dr. Justin  Koo,  a  lecturer  in  The  UWI  Faculty  of  Law; Tyrone Marcus, Senior Legal Officer in the Ministry of Sport  and  Youth  Affairs;  Regan  Asgarali,  an attorney attached to the Intellectual Property Office of Trinidad  and  Tobago;  and  Stefan  Fabien,  an experienced corporate lawyer who is a member of the Trinidad and Tobago Anti-Doping Committee.

## SODECO: Solutions for Developing Countries

T he University of the West Indies' Solutions for Developing Countries (UWI SODECO), the international research entity established in May 2013, is  making  progress  finding  solutions  to  medical and  socioeconomic  problems  affecting  Jamaica and  other  developing  countries.  UWI  SODECO works  through  its  two  divisions,  Solutions  for Medicine  (SFM)  focusing  on  medical  research, and Solutions for Society (SFS), focused on solving socioeconomic problems.

Based in Kingston, Jamaica at The UWI Mona Campus, Chief Scientist at SODECO is Professor Terrence Forrester. He says that SODECO's Solutions for Medicine team has implemented a research strategy to throw light on the molecular mechanisms  underlying  the  increased  risk  for obesity  and  cardiovascular  disease  experienced by populations with a history of malnutrition over generations,  against  a  background  of  the  global epidemic of obesity and associated diseases, hypertension, diabetes and their vascular consequences, stroke and heart attack.

Often ignored, notes Professor Forrester, are the negative impacts of malnutrition in early life on  brain  function,  impairing  cognition,  school performance,  behaviour  and  the  economic  and social  outcomes  in  adult  life.  So  Solutions  for Medicine  launched  its  research  project,  'Saving Brains from Malnutrition' in Navrongo, Northern Ghana  in  April  2019  with  collaborators  at  the Navrongo Health  Research  Centre.  This  project is  funded by Nutriset, the leading manufacturer of foods and supplements distributed by UNICEF for  the  treatment  of  severe  malnutrition  in  both public health  settings and  during  nutritional emergencies, e.g. in times of famine, disasters and conflict.  The  research  will  determine  whether supplying  missing  nutrients  using  supplements to  pregnant  and  lactating  women  (thence  their babies  out  to  two  years  old)  will  support  better brain development as a basis for improved cognition and behaviour.

Institutes of Health in the USA,  UK  ODA/ DiFID funds, and endowments from the private sector through The UWI  Development and Endowment Fund.  SODECO research is carried out  in  the  UWI  SODECO  Clinical  and  Basic Science Laboratories at Mona as well as in Ghana, Singapore,  New  Zealand  and  the  United  States in the laboratories of its international network of scientific collaborators.

Meanwhile,  UWI  SODECO's  Solutions  for Society  arm,  since  2017,  has  been  looking  at restoring  mangroves  as  a  means  of  adapting  to climate change. UWI SODECO has collaborated with  the  Institute  of  Marine  Affairs,  Trinidad (IMA); Coastal Engineering, The UWI St. Augustine;  Centre  for  the  Built  Environment, Seneca College, Canada; Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, San Diego; and  The  UWI  Centre  for  Marine  Sciences  to provide technical solutions for rehabilitating more than  1,000  hectares  of  significantly  degraded mangroves between Rocky Point JAMALCO Port and Farquhar Beach along the south coast of Clarendon.

In research training, UWI SODECO recently attended a Frontiers of Science meeting between UK  and  UWI  scientists  funded  and  hosted  by The  Royal  Society  at  Chicheley  Hall,  UK,  from March 19-21, 2019. It was the inaugural meeting in a three-year programme to advance use of science to  solve  big  problems  affecting  the  region,  such as climate change and environmental challenges to human development that impair health. Topics  of  low-carbon  energy  solutions,  societal resilience  and  developmental  biology  emerged as  study  areas.  A  proposal  was  developed  for this programme of work, organised by the Royal Society  and  SODECO,  focused  on  supporting the United Nations Global Goals for Sustainable Development.  As  part  of  its  Global  Challenges Research  Funding,  the  Royal  Society  has  set aside  £550K  over  three  years  to  establish  this programme.

## GLOBAL DIABETES Breakthrough

CLINICAL TRIAL MAY HELP SAVE LIVES AROUND THE WORLD

A path-breaking  study  offers  hope  to the one in five Caribbean people and the 400  million people  worldwide suffering with Type 2 diabetes.

Diabetes is one of the major chronic illnesses in  the  Caribbean  that  brings  with  it  a  range  of other health issues, including possible blindness and loss of limb. Given diabetes' link to diet and lifestyle,  The  UWI  Chronic  Disease  Research Centre  (CDRC)  at  the  Cave  Hill  Campus,  along with  Virgin  Unite,  the  Diabetes  Association  of Barbados and the Barbados Diabetes Foundation, launched  a  Barbados  Diabetes  Reversal  Study (BDRS).

As background to reasons for the study,  an earlier Health of the Nation 2011 study reported that 50% of the Barbadian population more than 65  years  old  had  a  diagnosis  of  Type  2  diabetes mellitus  (T2DM)    and  that  two-thirds  of  the population were overweight, which is a risk factor for the development of T2DM.

This study evaluated the possibility of reversing diabetes by adopting an eight-week very low-calorie diet, followed by weight maintenance, to restore blood sugar to healthy levels. The study of patients from a wide range of ages (20-70 years old) began in January 2015, and was led by Prof. Nigel  Unwin  of  The  UWI  CDRC,  building  on the work done by Prof. Roy Taylor at Newcastle University in the UK.

This  research  could  change  the  way  Type 2 Diabetes  is  treated  in  the  future,  with  the potential to save lives throughout the Caribbean and around the world.

With funding from Massy Foundation, a new study (BDRS2) with community 100 participants lay health advocates from  faithbased organisations have been trained to support and  monitor  their  congregants  who  meet  our inclusion criteria and are on the low-calorie diet. A community-based intervention could be more easily scaled-up to improve diabetes management by providing an accessible avenue for diagnostics, initial management  and  behavioural  support. In  total,  between  May  and  July  2018,  27  Health Advocates were trained.

## UNIVERSITIES CARIBBEAN: Bridge to Latin America

## PARTNERSHIPS AND COLLABORATIONS

T he UWI welcomes partnerships and collaborations and continues to contribute to the dialogues and outcomes in higher education.

## International Association of Universities

The University of the West Indies (The UWI) is selected by the IAU as lead university for SDG 13 (Climate Action), and joins 16 other universities from various geographic regions which will form part of this HESD Global Cluster supporting the advancement  of the sustainable development goals (SDGs).

## UDUAL

The  UWI  is  a  member  of  the  Unión  de Universidades  de  América  Latina  y  el  Caribe (UDUAL),  an  organisation  founded  in  1949  to deepen relationships among  Latin American universities and organisations such as the United Nations  and  Organisation  of  American  States (OAS). UDUAL facilitates the exchange of faculty, students, researchers and alumni among  its member universities, and shares research. At its General Assembly in December 2016 in Cordoba, Argentina, UDUAL  elected The UWI  ViceChancellor  as  Alternate  Vice  President  for  the Caribbean region

## Universities Caribbean

A new organisation called Universities Caribbean  aims  to  revitalise  and  integrate  the regional  university  sector  and  to  enhance  its quality and regional impact. This emerged from a  November  12-13,  2018  meeting  of  leaders  of

regional universities and research institutes that took place in the Dominican Republic. Replacing the former Association of Caribbean Universities and  Research  Institutes  (UNICA),    Universities Caribbean  recognises  that no one university can  find  answers  to  regional  problems  such  as climate-smart actions, Blue Economy innovation, poverty and security, and pledges the creation of a One Caribbean University System - that is the region's voice in the areas of quality, globalisation, resilience, and financial sustainability. ViceChancellor Professor Sir Hilary Beckles was elected as the first president of the newly launched Universities Caribbean.

## Emerge America: Hemispheric University Consortium

A Hemispheric University Consortium was created in April 2018 to provide a structure for students, faculty and researchers in the hemisphere to collaborate. The agreement emerged out of a meeting among the presidents of 11 universities across Latin America, the Caribbean,  Canada,  and  the  United  States.  The Consortium,  which  includes  universities  from Argentina,  Brazil,  Chile,  Colombia,  Costa  Rica, Mexico, Peru and the United States, is coordinated by the University of Miami.

The Consortium will promote discovery, learning,  understanding  and  a  higher  level  of integration across nations. Areas of interest include public health and  wellbeing; climate change, sustainability and resilience; gender issues; entrepreneurship and inclusive innovation; crime and corruption; cyber security, technology and  innovation  for  education;  and  sustainable development.

## Commonwealth of Learning

The  Commonwealth  of  Learning  (COL)  is an intergovernmental organisation created by Commonwealth Heads of Government to encourage the  development  and  sharing  of  open  learning and  distance  education  knowledge,  resources  and technologies.  The  University  of  the  West  Indies and  particularly  its Open  Campus  has  a  long history  of  collaboration  with  COL,  most  recently the development of the BSc in Youth Development Work which  will  now  be  offered  through  COL  as an Open Educational Resource to a consortium of universities throughout the Commonwealth.

The  COL  in  November  2016  conferred  the title of Honorary Fellow on Dr. Luz Longsworth, Pro  Vice-Chancellor  and  Principal  of  the  Open Campus  of  The  University  of  the  West  Indies, during  the  8th  Pan-Commonwealth  Forum  on Open Learning in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

## Association of Caribbean Tertiary Institutions

The UWI currently works with the Association of Caribbean Tertiary Institutions on inter-institutional  co-operation  in  areas  such  as accreditation,  equivalency  and  joint  programme development.

## Proposed Colleges of the UWI (CUWI) system

The UWI has invited all Caribbean governments which are committed to establishing a  university  college  to  pursue  this  goal  within  a proposed Colleges of The UWI (CUWI) system. The  UWI  is  reaching  out  to  all  interested  and qualified community colleges to make this happen. The idea is to develop a quality, accessible college  system  that  embraces  the  region.  So  far, seven  colleges  in  Jamaica  have  come  on  board: Bethlehem Moravian College, Sam Sharpe Teachers' College, GC Foster College of Physical Education, Church Teachers' College, Shortwood Teachers'  College,  St  Joseph  Teachers'  College, and Moneague College.

## BARACK OBAMA BIGS UP UWI

MONA CAMPUS TOWN HALL MEETING

<!-- image -->

T he UWI Regional Headquarters hosted its first ever meeting between an American President and the CARICOM Heads  of  Government  in  April  2015, when  Barack Obama  visited Jamaica before travelling onwards to attend the seventh Summit of the Americas in Panama.

Barack Obama was the first President of the United  States  to  visit  Jamaica  in  more  than  30 years  (the  last  was  Ronald  Reagan  in  1982),  and his  easy-going,  intelligent  diplomacy  didn't  go unnoticed when he participated in a Town Hall meeting at Mona Campus attended by 350 young Caribbean leaders.

Obama  took  the  opportunity  to  launch  his Young Leaders of the Americas Initiative (YLAI) to

expand opportunities for young (25 to 35-year-old) emerging entrepreneurs and civil society activists. The YLAI is the United States' premier exchange programme  in  the  hemisphere.  It  provides  250 fellowships each year to enable people from Latin America  and  the  Caribbean  to  develop  joint business and social entrepreneurship initiatives.

'The Mona Campus is delighted to have been the  host  for  the  launch  of  President  Obama's Initiative,'  said  Professor  Archibald  McDonald, who was the Mona Campus Principal at the time.

At  the  Town  Hall  meeting,  Obama  spoke  of the neighbourly relationship between the US and the  Caribbean:  'Tens  of  millions  of  Americans are  bound  to  the  Caribbean  and  the  Americas through  ties  of  commerce,  and  also  ties  of  kin.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

More  than  one  million  Americans  trace  their ancestry  to  Jamaica.    More  than  one  million Americans  visit  Jamaica  each  year.  So  we're committed to you and this region.'

He  spoke  about  America's  new  chapter in  its more  open  relations  with  Cuba  (now halted  under  a  different  President).  He  noted the  youthful  age  of  most  Latin  American  and Caribbean populations - more than 100 million being  between  the  ages  of  15  and  24  -  and praised young adults' good work ethic, sense of justice and idealism to make a better world.

'And unlike any other time in our history, the technology at your disposal means that you don't  have  to  wait  for  the  change  that  you're looking  for;  you  have  the  freedom  to  create  it in  your  own in powerful and disruptive ways.

Many  of  you  already  have,  whether  by  starting your  own  enterprises  or  by  helping  others  start theirs,' he said.

Obama singled out  two  remarkable  young leaders, Angeline Jackson who became a global activist, and Jerome Cowans who grew up in a tough part of Kingston and started the LEAD youth group to help others like him stay on the right path. That humble youth group eventually grew to six chapters and Cowans' work took him to five continents; he became the first Jamaican to receive the Nelson Mandela Innovation Award.

Through these examples, Obama made the  point  that  one  person  can  indeed  make  a difference  and  have  power  to  change  things  for the better.

## GLOBAL RECOGNITION

The UWI is globally recognised for excellence

## UWI ranked among TOP 5 % GLOBALLY

I f you have a UWI credential, it's a good time to smile. In a historic first for the institution, The UWI made it into the 2018 Times Higher Education  (THE)  Latin  America  University Rankings released in July 2018, placing 4th in the international outlook category and ranking 37th overall  among  the  top  129  regional  universities in  this  part  of  the  world.  And  shortly  after,  in another  first,  The  UWI  broke  into  THE's  2019 World University Rankings, the only Caribbean institution on the world-wide list. It's a remarkable achievement for a debut ranking, to be alongside the  largest,  wealthiest  universities,  private  and public, in some of the biggest countries.

These rankings put The UWI in the elite band of the top 5% of universities worldwide (based on data showing that globally, there are over 25,000 recognised  universities) and  top  3%  in  Latin America and the Caribbean.

A highly respected assessment tool, the Times  University  Rankings  are  used  by  many students around the world to guide them in their university  choices,  and  trusted  by  governments and other entities alike. The rankings assess five categories covering the core missions of all worldclass, global universities: Teaching, Research, Citations  (research  influence),  Industry  Income and International Outlook.

'The University of the West Indies ...is similarly... highly international. But unlike many of its peers, the bulk of its global transformation has taken place in just a handful of years, as opposed to several decades or centuries.'

- - Times Higher Education

As THE says on its website, 'Universities are no longer compared just with rivals in their own city,  or  even  their  own  country;  world-leading universities are competing globally and attracting students and researchers from across the world. International outlook is therefore a mark of a top institution,  relevant  both  to  international  and domestic students.'

Commenting on the University's performance in the ranking schemes, Vice-Chancellor Beckles noted,  'The  excellence  of  The  UWI  has  been a  well-kept  secret  for  far  too  long.  Now,  with these very impressive  global ranking  results, we  can  begin  to  share  with  the  world  the  story of  this  academic  enterprise  in  the  West  Indies that highlights the intellectual achievement and  scholastic  contributions  of  the  Caribbean community.'

## Internationally Fine Flavour Cocoa

T he Cocoa Research Centre (CRC) located at The UWI  St. Augustine Campus  in  Trinidad  is  custodian  of the International Cocoa Genebank, Trinidad (ICG,T), which is one of the largest and most  diverse  collection  of  cocoa  germplasm  in the  world.  The  Genebank,  located  at  a  100-acre site  at  the  University  Cocoa  Research Station in Centeno, is a world class collection of more than 2,300  accessions  representing  the  major  cacao groups, and is recognised globally by Biodiversity International, CACAONET and the FAO Trust.

From  the  inception  of  cocoa  research  in Trinidad  and  Tobago,  the  task  of  assembling the ICG,T  has  spanned  decades  of  virtually continuous effort since 1982. A large part of this success  is  owed  to  the  cadre  of  a  succession  of reputable scientists associated with this historical centre  of  excellence  in  cocoa  research.  A  main source  of  original  material  for  the  ICG,T  was Marper  Farm,  established  by  agronomist  Dr.  F. J.  Pound  following  his  expeditions  to  the  upper Amazon from 1937 to 1942.

PROJECT LEAD: Professor Pathmanathan Umaharan, Head, Cocoa Research Centre

The CRC is today a vibrant institution  with  strong international ties and  plays an important role in contributing to current research in cocoa as well as maintaining  its  mandate  to conserve, characterise, evaluate, utilise and  distribute material from its

internationally recognised germplasm collection. Caribbean cocoa is internationally known for its fine/flavour  cocoa,  and  Trinidad  and  Tobago  in particular has a global reputation for its quality.

The CRC has more than 80 years of research under  its  belt  through  its  previous  incarnations as the Cocoa Research Scheme, established in  1930  under  the  Imperial  College  of  Tropical Agriculture;  the  subsequent  Regional  Research Centre  set  up  in  1955;  and  the  Cocoa  Research Unit, formed in 1963, which was later restructured and renamed the Cocoa Research Centre.

In addition to its scientific research, the CRC provides certification, post-harvest support, chocolate-making  support,  DNA  fingerprinting, breeding  support  and  disease  screening,  which are  paid  services  for  clients  throughout  Latin America and the Caribbean, earning useful foreign exchange.

The CRC has also been running its own small in-house  chocolate  factory  in  The  UWI  since 2012, making a delicious 70% dark chocolate bar from  locally  grown  cocoa.  And  it  has  big  plans to  construct  and  manage  an  International  Fine Cocoa Innovation Centre (IFCIC), a project being partly  funded  by  a  €2  million  grant  from  the European Union/African, Caribbean and Pacific Science and Technology Fund.

The IFCIC is the brainchild of plant genetics

expert, Professor Pathmanathan Umaharan, who leads the Cocoa Research Centre tucked away in a  wing  of  the  Frank  Stockdale  building  at  The UWI St. Augustine. The IFCIC aims to rejuvenate Trinidad and Tobago's cocoa sector by helping to develop and spread better technologies, skills and quality products, as well as seed a lively, delicious, indigenous cocoa culture. IFCIC partners include the  European  Union,  the  African,  Caribbean and  Pacific  Group  of  States,  the  ACP  Science &amp;  Technology  Programme,  The  UWI,  and  the Caribbean Fine Cocoa Forum.

The IFCIC will comprise a chocolate factory, a business incubator facility, a living museum of cocoa plants, a cocoa tourism centre, a restaurant, kitchen and  labs,  and  a  Chocolate  Academy  for  courses in  chocolate  making.  The  chocolate  factory  will produce cocoa nibs, cocoa liquor (the unsweetened liquid base for chocolate), and couverture or finished chocolate (both dark and milk). The idea is to have a total bean-to-bar model to stimulate the sector and enable applied research to have real community and industry impact.

Professor  Umaharan  has  long  had  a  vision for the huge potential of the Trinidad and Tobago cocoa  industry.  Seven  years  ago,  on  behalf  of the CRC, he applied to The UWI's RDI Fund to do  a  special  project  on  the  genetic  control  and identifying markers for some specific cocoa traits. The  project, approved  in  2012, looked at cocoa yield, pod characteristics, disease resistance, cadmium  bioaccumulation,  rooting characteristics and flavour.

The project soon became a rising star among the RDI-funded  projects  because  its  findings attracted significant additional external funding to support more CRC work. For instance, it helped attract the EU/ACP €2.6 million funding to help build  the  International  Fine  Cocoa  Innovation Centre. It also helped secure €500,000 in funding from ECA/CAOBISCO/FCC for a five-year project on mitigation of cadmium in cocoa, which is a  growing  health  concern.  And  the  MARS chocolate company  is funding a joint cocoa genome sequencing project, where the CRC has partnered with Stanford University in the USA.
