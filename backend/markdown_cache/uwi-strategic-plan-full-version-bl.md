Page 8: The statue of  our University's Founding Father, Sir Philip Sherlock on the grounds of  the Mona Campus. He was a member of the Irvine Commission which conceived the University College of  the West Indies. According to this committee, 'The problems of  the West Indies will never be fully solved unless they are understood and investigated, to a far greater extent at present, in the West Indies by West Indians.'

## FOREWORD

The University of the West Indies (UWI) is at a pivotal point of  its history . While in the last five to ten years, we have made significant advances in increasing student numbers, growth of a competitive academic staff, number of undergraduate, professional and graduate programmes offered, capital development projects on all our campuses set in aesthetically pleasing landscapes, advanced and more integrated information and library systems, more robust relationships with our governments, and expanded outreach to UWI-12+1 countries, there is still much ground to cover in achieving our collective vision of  being a globally recognised, regionally integrated, innovative, and internationally competitive university , deeply rooted in all aspects of  Caribbean development. A recent marker of  our progress is evidenced in the accreditation reports of  the Mona and the St. Augustine Campuses, which indicated that the University is on the right track with respect to the management of its affairs. Perhaps our greatest challenge is in garnering the financial resources necessary to sustain the gains we have made, so that we may drive regional development more effectively and receive the global recognition that an institution of  our size and composition can attain.

The global economic crisis and its dire effects on the Caribbean have meant that government contributions have been flat or have declined in the last three years, and arrears in payment have ballooned to worrisome proportions. Questions abound about how the Caribbean will cope in an increasingly competitive and dynamic world. As if  the financial challenges were not enough, we must contend with increasing competition for students and resources from emerging national universities and international institutions of  all types. A perception still exists, posited in some reality , that the University is too bureaucratic, inefficient and slow to contend with the competitive challenges that face us, as well as to respond to the development needs of the Caribbean. There is concern also that the University is disintegrating into increasingly national entities pursuing singularly local goals-a formulation that, if  it were to become true, would mean loss of  a considerable regional enterprise. While some of  these fears are exaggerated and by no means new, it would be unacceptable that our institution should be allowed to 'drift' because decisive steps are not taken to address the challenges we face. Contending with these challenges, even as we celebrate signal gains, is what makes this moment

'pivotal.' Realisation of  our collective vision will rely on capitalising on our relatively rich intellectual and infrastructural resources (resources not shared in magnitude by any other tertiary institution in the English-speaking Caribbean), and linking these more effectively with the private sector, government and other sectors, as well as with multilateral development agencies in the region.

It is in these circumstances that we embark on the 2012-2017 Strategic Plan, which seeks to transform the institution into a 'global player ,' while serving as a driving force for Caribbean development. Important goals of the Plan include financial selfreliance; a more engaged and able staff; improved operational efficiency; enhanced teaching, learning, research and innovation; expanded regional and national engagement; and international outreach. Critical to our success will be our ability to better mobilise our collective regional strength, even when serving national agendas.

If  we are to attain the heights to which we aspire, more involvement of  our total university community-academic and non-academic-is an imperative. While our 2007-2012 Plan was constructed through a process of  university-wide input, it is evident that one of  the factors that impeded full implementation was that large sectors of  our staff  were not engaged. In the 2012-2017 Plan, we have not only mobilised our campus communities to prepare the Plan, but have also utilised face-to-face engagements with all sectors of  the University-academic and faculty boards, ATS staff  and students-to present and discuss the Plan. A university web portal was created, which invited and enabled input from persons in the community who wished to offer comments and suggestions. Going forward, we are utilising the Balanced Scorecard framework, accompanied by leadership enrichment exercises and other initiatives to ensure that all units can prepare action plans for implementation. We shall ensure that our progress can be objectively monitored at regular intervals.

Our moment is 'pivotal.' Success will require individual commitment, creative thinking and execution. It is a moment when every one of  us must become a leader - each of  us, an instrument of  change.

## ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

The drafting of  the 2012-2017 UWI Strategic Plan was a collaborative effort involving multiple stakeholders throughout the process. Individuals and teams from every academic and administrative division across the four campuses were actively engaged in various ways. The contributions and efforts of  all of these stakeholders have been instrumental in the preparation of  this Strategic Plan. I would like to thank all of  those persons who contributed to the exercise and especially the staff  in the University Office of  Planning and Development (UOPD) who worked with me to put together this document which draws on several submissions, reports, meetings and discussions across the University. I am looking forward to the continued support of  staff, students and other stakeholders as we move into the implementation stage of  the planning process.

## 1.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

## 1.1. INTRODUCTION

The Strategic Plan 2012-2017 of the UWI has been prepared in an environment characterised by regional economic volatility and uncertainty, increasing competition in the provision of  higher education services, changes in information and communications technology, growth in the demand for higher education and the desire to find solutions to pressing national and regional issues. These factors have created a 'new normal' for the UWI.

The UWI, as the leading tertiary level institution in the English-speaking Caribbean, is charged with meeting the region's 'high level' human resource needs and also assisting with the resolution of  the development issues facing the region. It also has to compete in the international higher education market and demonstrate some global impact in the areas of teaching, research and advisory services.

In a highly competitive environment, the UWI has to leverage its resources or core competencies in order to

achieve competitive advantage in three key areas: the delivery of accredited quality programmes at reasonable costs; the generation of  impactful cutting-edge research and innovation; the achievement of  operational excellence (involving talent management, efficient processes, information technology and customer service) to provide quick responses to stakeholders.

## 1.2. REVIEW OF STRATEGIC PLAN 2007-2012

The Strategic Plan 2007-2012 contains four core strategic focal areas: Teaching and Learning; Graduate Studies; Research and Innovation; and Service to the UWI12 Countries and Other Underserved Communities. A review of  the Strategic Plan 2007-2012, to date, indicates some degree of  success in all the areas in spite of  the resource constraints occasioned by the decline in economic activity since 2008.

Some of the notable achievements include the following: (i) the increase in enrolment in degree programmes

by 25 per cent over the 2007-2008 to 2011-2012 period; (ii) the launching of  the Open Campus in 2008 and the Western Jamaica Campus in 2008; (iii) the introduction of  the Certificate in University Teaching and Learning; (iv) the strengthening of  quality assurance and the commencement of  the accreditation of  the UWI; (v) the growth in graduate students (especially in taught degrees) and the strengthening of  student support systems; (vi) the establishment of research clusters and increased international research collaboration; (vii) the continued upgrade of enterprise software systems; (viii) the introduction of  formal staff  assessment systems; (ix) the strengthening of marketing and communications offices on the various campuses; (x) the promotion of self-financing courses/ programmes; (xi) the establishment of  sports programmes across the campuses; (xii) the establishment of  franchising arrangements and articulation agreements with other tertiary level institutions (TLIs); (xiii) the hosting of  a range of national and regional conferences to discuss development issues; and (xiv) the initiation of  memoranda of understanding (MOUs) with several universities and other institutions.

An environmental analysis of  the UWI points to several internal strengths and weaknesses along with

several external opportunities and threats, as set out in Table 1.

## 1.3. THE MISSION, VISION &amp; CORE VALUES OF THE UWI

The foundation elements of  the Strategic Plan of  the UWI are its Mission, Vision, Core Values and Strategic Goals.

## 1.4. KEY ATTRIBUTES OF THE UWI GRADUATE

The key attributes of  the UWI graduate refer to those academic abilities, skills, personal and professional qualities that should be acquired by students during their sojourn at the UWI. A distinctive UWI graduate should demonstrate that he/she is: a critical and creative thinker; an effective communicator with good interpersonal skills; ITskilled and information literate; innovative and entrepreneurial; globally aware and well grounded in his/her regional identity; socially , culturally and environmentally responsible; and guided by strong ethical values.

While these attributes apply to all graduates, it is expected that special emphasis would be placed on leadership, goal setting and the ability to make a significant contribution to new knowledge, especially in the case of  the postgraduate student.

## 1.5. KEY ATTRIBUTES OF THE UWI EMPLOYEE

An important core competency for the UWI lies in its human resources. It is therefore expected that the UWI employee should demonstrate the following attributes: job-related knowledge and skills; critical and

creative thinking skills; responsible attitude to work-life balance; institutional loyalty and engagement; positive customer service; and respectful and ethical behaviour. The nature of  these attributes would vary according to the discipline or sphere of  responsibility of  the employee.

## 1.6 STRATEGIC PERSPECTIVES AND THEMES

The Strategic Plan 2012-2017 utilises the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) framework for linking the vision of the UWI to its strategic goals and associated objectives. This framework allows for the identification of different perspectives of  the UWI's operations. The six Perspectives, with their respective Themes, have been identified as follows:

## PERSPECTIVE 1:

## Financial

Themes: Income Source Diversification; Recapitalisation of the UWI; and Efficient Resource Utilisation

## PERSPECTIVE 2:

## Employee Engagement and Development

Themes: Competency-based Development; Culture of Employee Engagement; and Strengthening Performance Management Systems

## PERSPECTIVE 3:

## Internal Operational Processes

Themes: Efficient and Effective Academic and Administrative Processes; Governance Arrangements; and Management Structures

## PERSPECTIVE 4:

## Teaching, Learning and Student Development

Themes: Academic Quality; Student Engagement and Experience; and Open and Distance Education

## PERSPECTIVE 5: Research and Innovation

Themes: Faculty-led Research and Innovation; Graduate Studies and Student Research; and Funding and Partnerships

## PERSPECTIVE 6: Outreach

Themes: National and Regional Development; Internationalisation; Marketing and Communication; and Alumni Engagement

Within each theme, there are a set of Goals and within each Goal there are a set of  Objectives, which will guide the Operational Planning process.

An overview of  the Strategic Framework for the 2012-2017 Strategic Plan is shown in Figure 1 on page 20.

## 1.7. IMPLEMENTATION FRAMEWORK

The Strategic Plan embodies a five-year perspective, which will be continuously monitored and evaluated. Its realisation will require the involvement and commitment of  all members of  the university community. The overall strategic planning process will be coordinated by the Executive Management Team (EMT), headed by the Vice Chancellor. The University Office of Planning and Development (UOPD), in association with Campus Planning offices, will provide support in monitoring and evaluating progress with the Strategic Plan.

The Strategic Plan 2012-2017 will be supplemented with biennial Operational Plans, which will coincide with the current financing arrangements of the UWI. The Operational Plans will employ a BSC framework, which allows for the linking of  strategy to vision through the creation of  a system of objectives, initiatives and projects, measures/indicators, timelines, responsibilities and resource needs to ensure the proper monitoring of  the implementation of  the Strategic Plan. Annual reviews of  these Operational Plans will be undertaken, while biennial reviews will be carried out for the Strategic Plan. An electronic

information system based on the BSC framework will be developed to facilitate the smooth monitoring and evaluation of  the Strategic and Operational Plans.

## 1.8. CONCLUSION

The successful implementation of the Strategic Plan and the associated Operational Plans will depend on several critical success factors, namely, effective management and creative leadership at all levels of the UWI; adequate human and financial resources; an appropriate accountability mechanism; an adequate incentive system; widespread buy-in and support of staff  and other stakeholders; crosscampus collaboration; and effective communication and information management.

The successful implementation of the 2012-2017 Strategic Plan will transform the UWI by 2017. As such, by 2017, the UWI will be closer to realising its vision as a University committed to excellence, with a thirst for generating knowledge and educating the leaders of  tomorrow. It would have invested and built on its strengths in its areas of  competitive advantage, thereby impacting positively on the region and beyond. The University will be driven by a culture of  engagement and inclusion,

and would have become more student-centred and focussed on academic excellence.

Further, the UWI would have expanded access to knowledge and education throughout the Caribbean region and beyond. It would have re-engineered its systems and processes resulting in increased productivity and efficiency , and become a better steward of  its fiscal and physical resources. It would have met the challenges and emerged a stronger and more cohesive and integrated regional university contributing to the inclusive development of the Caribbean and having a global impact.

## 2.0 I NTRODUCTION

The Strategic Plan 2012-2017 of  the UWI has been prepared in an environment characterised by regional economic volatility and uncertainty, increasing competition in the provision of  higher education services, changes in technology and its use in higher education, the growth in demand for higher education and the pressure to find solutions to the pressing development issues of  the Caribbean region. These factors have created a 'new normal' environment within which the UWI has to operate over the next five years.

The period of reduced economic activity in the region, which started in late 2008, has adversely affected the funding of  the UWI by regional governments. Several initiatives proposed in the Strategic Plan 2007-2012 had to be scaled back, revised or shelved due to the lack of  resources. It is expected that there will be a slow recovery of  the regional economies over the first two years of  the Strategic Plan 2012-2017. Public resources available to the UWI will therefore be constrained and could impact on implementation of some elements of the Plan.

The liberalisation of  higher education services and the rapid spread of information and communications technology (ICT) have resulted in a greater degree of  competition in the higher education market, and also in the increased demand for flexible learning products. Furthermore, the increase in the output of  the secondary level educational system has pushed up the demand for tertiary level education, as persons seek to enhance their chances of  gaining employment in a highly competitive labour market.

The UWI is a regional tertiary level educational institution charged with the responsibility of  meeting the 'high level' human resource needs and assisting with the resolution of  the development issues facing the Caribbean region. As a 'relatively large' university (over 47,000 students), it has to compete in the global higher education market and demonstrate some global impact on teaching, research and advisory services in selected niche markets.

The nature of  the environment within which the UWI has to operate and the resources that are available to it mean that it must adopt a disciplined and focussed approach to planning and decision- and policy- making in order to maintain or achieve long-term sustainability.  It must develop creative initiatives and solutions to respond to the challenges it faces. This is the nature of  strategic planning in an uncertain environment.

In a highly competitive environment characterised by economic volatility and uncertainty, the UWI has to leverage its core competencies (areas in which it has specific expertise beyond its competitors), which lie in its intellectual capital and information and communications technology (ICT) to achieve competitive advantage in three key areas:

- · Delivery of accredited quality programmes (for example, degrees, diplomas, certificates) at reasonable costs
- · Generation of impactful, cutting-edge research and innovative outputs, especially for targeted niche markets
- · Achievement of operational excellence (involving talent management, efficient processes, information technology and customer service) to provide a quick response/agility to the needs of stakeholders

Although the UWI has made significant progress in these areas over the 2007-2012 planning period, there is need for further consolidation and strategic expansion in selected areas in order to distinguish itself  within the higher education landscape of the region, as well as to enhance its international reputation.

Over the 2012-2017 planning period, the UWI will continue to build capacity in an efficient manner in order to effectively address the range of  development challenges facing the region (e.g., production diversification and economic growth, high level of  poverty and inequality , the effect of  climate change, the rise of  chronic non-communicable diseases, the scourge of  crime and violence, the strengthening of  human security and governance systems). Through its core functions of  teaching, research and public advisory service, the UWI will continue to offer solutions to the region's development challenges, while at the same time contributing to the global intellectual discourse. These initiatives lie at the heart of  the mission of  the UWI.

The process for developing this Strategic Plan formally started with the Fourth Annual Review of the Implementation of  the Strategic Plan, 2007-2012 (St. Augustine, August 2011). The 2012-2017 Plan was developed through structured and inclusive cross-campus consultations led by the four Campus Strategic Planning Teams and the Vice Chancellery Team, and coordinated by the University Office of  Planning and Development (UOPD). A web portal was also established to solicit comments from internal and external stakeholders. A Strategic Plan Consensus Retreat (Mona, December 2011) was subsequently held to integrate components of  the Strategic Plan into a cohesive document and to achieve consensus on the various elements of  the Plan. Further engagement processes with all stakeholders were held at the four campuses to discuss the first draft of  the Strategic Plan. The resulting Plan has been carefully constructed through the synthesis and integration of  feedback from staff, students and other stakeholders, reports from the Campus Strategic Planning Teams and the Vice Chancellery Team, and reports of  special Working Groups.

This Strategic Planning document contains a brief  overview of  the achievements and challenges associated with the 2007-2012 Strategic Plan and a presentation of  the current strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats facing the UWI. This assessment of  the UWI's performance and environmental analysis is followed by the mission and vision statements guiding the UWI over the planning period, along with the core values of  the University and the key attributes of  the UWI graduate and employee. The strategic goals and associated high-order objectives are stated from six perspectives or dimensions of  the UWI's operations: Financial; Employee Engagement and Development; Internal Operational Processes; Teaching, Learning and Student Development; Research and Innovation; and Outreach (National and Regional Development; Internationalisation; Marketing and Communication; and Alumni Engagement). The Strategic Plan uses an integrated framework, which involves the following elements:

- · Strategic Perspectives of  the UWI's Operations (and causal relationships among them);
- · Strategic Themes with elaborations within the Perspectives;
- · Strategic Goals and Objectives (which will guide the Operational aspects of  the Plan).

These six perspectives and their corresponding themes, goals and objectives are viewed as linked together in an integrated strategic framework (see Figure

2), and each element is integral to the process of  achieving the mission and vision of  the UWI.

This integrated strategic framework will shape operational planning, the biennial budget process and overall university activities and operations. The implementation framework and the critical success factors for the Strategic Plan are also presented.

While the Strategic Plan 2012-2017 builds on the achievements realised in the Strategic Plan 2007-2012, it also seeks to address the challenges associated with the new educational and socio-economic environment.

## REVIEW OF PERFORMANCE 2007-2012

This section summarises the main achievements of  the Strategic Plan 2007-2012 by strategic theme. The 2007-2012 Strategic Plan, entitled STRIDE (Strategic Transformation for Relevance, Impact, Distinctiveness and Excellence), provided the basis for the development and execution of  a fundamental paradigm shift in culture, processes and leadership as the University responded to the changing demands on the tertiary education sector in the region. A more detailed analysis can be found in the report entitled:  Strategic Plan 2007-2012: Four-Year Review 20072008 to 2010-2011.

The ten strategic themes of the Strategic Plan, with the number of supporting 'strategies' in parentheses, were:

- i. Teaching and Learning (8)
- ii. Graduate Studies (7)
- iii. Research and Innovation (5)
- iv . Service to the UWI-12 Countries and Other Underserved Communities (4)
- v. Transforming the Leadership and Administrative Culture and Processes (8)
- vi. Marketing and Branding (2)
- vii. Funding the Enterprise (30)
- viii. Strengthening Regionality (15)
- ix. Strengthening National Engagement Processes (8)
- x. International Partnerships (Internationalisation) (18)

## 3.1. TEACHING &amp; LEARNING

Teaching and learning continued to improve in three domains:  classroom, online and blended learning. The Open Campus (OC), which was formally launched in 2008, dominated with respect to fully webdelivered courses. The Instructional Development Units (IDU) started training in blended learning for residential campuses.

The UWI continued to serve the human resource needs of the region through its Mona, Cave Hill, St. Augustine and Open Campuses by expanding enrolment over the planning cycle 2007-2008 to 20112012 by 24.4 per cent, reaching a record 45,877 students (excl. certificates and diplomas) in 20112012 from 36,874 in 2007-2008.

Overall, total first degree enrolment increased by 23.4 per cent from 29,820 in 2007-2008 to 36,690 in 2011-2012, while higher degree and advanced diploma enrolment increased by 30.2 per cent from 7,054 in 2007-2008 to 9,187 in 2011-2012.

The Certificate in University Teaching and Learning (CUTL) was introduced, mainly for new staff, with increased enrolment promising to be a powerful force for improved teacher education and quality . Greater efforts were made to enhance the proficiency levels of incoming students in both English and Mathematics. Institutional and programme accreditation processes were completed or are in progress, and it is anticipated that all campuses should complete the accreditation exercise by the end of  the 2011-2012 academic year. Improvements were made in Curriculum and Pedagogical Reform (CPR) and several new and cutting-edge programmes were introduced. An external review of  the Quality Assurance Unit (QAU) was conducted, which resulted in wideranging recommendations for the continued development of the quality assurance function at the UWI.

## 3.2. GRADUATE STUDIES

Support systems and graduate supervision were strengthened in light of increased enrolment. A Graduate

Studies and Research Information Portal (GRIP) was developed and a Thesis/Progress Tracker to promote transparency of the examination/ mentoring process is being developed. Student instruction in research methods was improved and supervisor training courses were conducted. Quality assurances reviews were conducted to improve the curriculum and evaluation methods. Informed by the policy on Inter-Campus and International Collaboration, the UWI promoted partnerships with top-ranked universities to develop graduate studies and research capacity as well as student exchanges.

## 3.3. RESEARCH &amp; INNOVATION

Several new policy and procedural documents in support of research and innovation have been developed and taken through the relevant University Boards for approval. University-wide working groups were established in the following clusters: Climate Change, Renewable Energy, Food Security, Disaster Risk Reduction, Sustainable Development and Caribbean Sea Governance. These working groups were selected based on the perceived importance of the cluster for national and regional development, and on the current absence of  a UWI institute or centre to drive research in these clusters. Significant research was conducted in areas of  socio-economic and cultural interest relevant to the

Caribbean through the established institutes, centres, faculties and departments, as well as through the newly established working groups. A more focussed and structured approach to accessing grants was put into place, which yielded greater results than in previous years. An enhanced culture of innovation and enterprise resulted in the production of  several patents and improvements in the process of  commercialising discoveries. Research Days at the various campuses continued to serve as the platform through which members of the academic community exposed the public to innovations and outstanding research projects.

## 3.4. SERVICE TO THE UWI-12 COUNTRIES &amp; OTHER UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES

A branch campus of Mona was established in Western Jamaica in 2008. Bermuda became an associate contributing country in August 2010, thus, creating the UWI-12+1.

The Open Campus made studentcentred improvements as well as significant enhancements to their technological and physical infrastructure since its establishment. Several sites in the Open Campus Country Sites (OCCS) responded to an increased demanded for workforce development programmes, and saw

a growth in partnerships with local, regional and international entities to design and develop training programmes at the local level.

The Campus continued to seek ways in which to assist Haiti after the 2010 earthquake and St. Lucia after the devastation caused by Hurricane Tomas. It submitted a proposal to the Leadership Development for Higher Education Reform (LEADHER) and received 10,000 Euros to facilitate visits to Quisqueya University , Haiti to assess the infrastructural capacity for the preparation of online delivery of courses and programmes in teacher education and other areas. In addition, the Campus offered four scholarships for students from Haiti to study online. With the aid of the Barbados Coast Guard, the OC sent several shipments of water and supplies to St. Lucia for distribution to those in need. The Campus established an account with surplus funds for the purpose of building an emergency fund to help students in need.

## 3.5. TRANSFORMING THE LEADERSHIP &amp; ADMINISTRATIVE CULTURE PROCESSES

There was continuous upgrading and operationalisation of additional modules of the three main enterprise software systems, Banner Student, Banner Finance, and PeopleSoft, to allow for maximum efficiency and

utilisation. Employee Engagement became a prominent theme, which was expressed through paying more attention to employee needs and providing support to them to both build loyalty and enhance productivity . Quality assurance improvements for student needs were implemented, ranging from improved systems and services to training for academic staff, and leadership and managerial skills for senior administrative staff. A Pro Vice Chancellor (PVC) was reappointed to head the University Office of Planning and Development (UOPD).

During the period, the Vice Chancellor's Awards for Excellence in Teaching, Administration and Research Accomplishments, Service to the University Community, and Contributions to Public Service continued to recognise the high achievements of  academic and senior administrative staff  of  the UWI. Principal's awards were also introduced on some campuses for outstanding achievement among staff. A departmental quality award scheme was also developed.

## 3.6. MARKETING &amp; BRANDING

Promotion of the UWI locally , regionally and internationally through the mass media has continued, with the utilisation of  more online channels of  communication and interaction.

An internal communications strategy relating to STRIDE was developed and implemented in part at St. Augustine as part of  the accreditation programme.

The strengthening and aligning of the Marketing and Communications (M&amp;C) functions across the University system was facilitated through participation by M&amp;C staff at professional development workshops. These provided the additional tools to spearhead the development of several policies and initiatives to effectively manage the University's image and identity .

At the campus level, the M&amp;C offices at the Cave Hill and Mona campuses benefitted from some restructuring over the period. These changes were all made with the view of  improving efficiency and building capacity.

## 3.7. FUNDING THE ENTERPRISE

The main thrust here, especially since the global economic downturn, has been to identify alternative sources of income to the traditional government subventions, which have been in decline. An immediate reaction has been to incur more long-term debt within safe limits. The most significant increases occurred from self-financing activities and tuition fee hikes. On the cost-saving side, efficient use of  resources has been emphasised, including the elimination

of  academic programmes with low enrolments that are not economically justifiable and greater use of  ICT .

## 3.8. STRENGTHENING REGIONALITY

Regionality of  the UWI is manifested both structurally and culturally within the University. The University continues to operationalise its regional character through initiatives like the establishment of  the Open Campus and the establishment of  articulation and franchise arrangements with TLIs throughout the region. Further, partnerships have been pursued at the programme level with public and private sector agencies involving all of the Campuses. As part of  the thrust towards regional engagement, that is, service to stakeholders, the University has provided technical advisory services to contributing countries of the UWI and has also contributed to the development of  regional polices through CARICOM.

Regionality can also be taken to mean the operational unification of  the UWI as one University with four campuses. One example of progress made in this regard is the establishment of  the Single Virtual Library Space (UWILinC) which provides a single point of  access to all library resources in all four campuses. The proposed Single Virtual University

Space (SVUS) will further provide the platform for operational unification of  the UWI, allowing it to function as one university with four campuses. The following still need more integration across campuses: faculty structure, common curriculum, movement of faculty and students, research and administrative systems. The UWI further actualises its regionality through its course content, student relationships, mode of financing and cross-faculty collaboration.

## 3.9. STRENGTHENING NATIONAL ENGAGEMENT PROCESSES

As an institution, the UWI continues to be responsive to national needs and realities. To this end, it has utilised its resources to support contributing countries on national initiatives to achieve economic, environmental and social development. In this regard, members of  the academic community work towards influencing policy formation, drafting legislation and providing public service. This is reflected at all levels of  the University .

## 3.10. INTERNATIONAL PARTNERSHIPS (INTERNATIONALISATION)

Academic links were established with several institutions globally . Some notable examples include: the Mona Department of Government, Sociology

and Social Work (GSSW) initiated a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the University of Calgary and the UWI in 2010-2011 for social work programmes; the Confucius Institute was launched in June 2010 at Mona to facilitate the teaching/ learning of the Chinese language as well as research on the Chinese homeland, its cultures and people. The Cave Hill Campus has also established an agreement with the Government of  China. Internally , the Cave Hill International Office and Mona's International Students Office (ISO) were both established in mid-2008.

## 3.11. COMMON CHALLENGES

All of  this progress has taken place despite significant challenges. The principal challenge that impacted upon just about every strategic initiative (project) was the lack of resources, exacerbated by the global economic downturn in 2008. This resulted in longer timelines for completion of  projects and activities.

Some projects were planned but not implemented, perhaps due to inadequate organisation and project management skills, the heavy workload of some parties, or the imperatives of operational matters that required more immediate attention. Few internal projects (not externally funded) had dedicated staff (most were doing work part-time in

addition to their substantive duties). Projects that required cross-departmental or cross-campus cooperation often suffered due to lack of coordination and differing priorities.

Some projects or systems required special expertise that was not available internally and too expensive to either hire or outsource. Information in many cases was difficult to find or collect, thus affecting the quality of deliverables or the assumptions on which the projects were founded. These same constraints affected measurement of their effectiveness.

In general, there was inconsistent and incomplete reporting across the University about strategic initiatives. Up until July 2010, reports were submitted by departments in a tabular, paper-based form and summarised manually by the UOPD. After that point, the UWI Performance Monitoring and Management System (PMMS) was implemented but has been plagued by operational problems and a low compliance rate, which have yielded incomplete results. The regular production of  institutional reports necessary for monitoring the progress of  the implementation of the Strategic Plan was hindered by the lack of  timely and quality data from constituents.

## STRENGTHS, WEAKNESSES, OPPORTUNITIES, THREATS (SWOT) ANALYSIS

Many of the internal strengths and weaknesses, and external opportunities and threats (SWOT) have remained the same as in the previous strategic plan, and new ones emerged over the planning period. This section outlines the SWOT factors as identified by the campus planning teams and the strategic planning feedback portal. These factors have assisted in the development of strategies that are intended to turn opportunities and weaknesses into strengths.

## 4.1.  STRENGTHS

- a. The University's Reputation - The UWI is the premier tertiary education institution in the Anglophone Caribbean.
- b. Regional University - The UWI, as a result of  being a regional university , can be more flexible than national universities as it has a broader governance structure that prevents it from being subjected to a particular jurisdictional power. It continues to function as a regional entity and to impact on the human

resource development and public policy needs of  the region. The UWI is positioned to benefit from economies of scale and scope while ensuring subsidiarity and complementarity. It is one of  the entities that promotes a transnational/Pan-Caribbean identity to add value and that seeks to advance the transfer of  knowledge for regional development.

- c. Campus Diversity - The diversity of  the campuses and the campus populations provides for a richly diverse intellectual and social environment, which can contribute to enhancing institutional excellence and capability through cutting-edge research, innovative approaches to teaching and learning, and scholarship that reflects the plurality of  perspectives. This diversity provides the platform for the University to leverage that strength to achieve its vision.
- d. Physical Asset Base - The University possesses a significant physical infrastructure to

serve the diverse needs of stakeholders. Its natural and built environment are conducive to reflection and learning.

## e. Human Resource Development - The

University continues to meet a considerable proportion of  the human resource needs of the region with a current enrolment of  over 47,000 students and up to 9,000 graduates annually.

- f. Intellectual Capital - The UWI attracts and develops a cadre of  nationally , regionally and internationally talented employees who have contributed to, and continue to impact positively on, the development of  the region.

## g. Academic Quality

- Assurance - Quality assurance systems have been greatly strengthened over the past five years, especially in light of accreditation exercises.
- h. Advisory Capacity - The UWI continues to be a dominant source for research, consulting, and policy-making resources for other sectors to draw upon.
- i. Knowledge Repository -The UWI is a rich repository of unique collections of  Caribbean knowledge and artefacts, including books, reports, papers, flora and fauna.

## 4.2. WEAKNESSES

- a. Management and People Skills - There is lack of  general supervisory , management, leadership and people skills.

## b. Technical Competencies

- - Staff  members need improvement in teaching skills, process design, change management, planning and strategy execution.
- c. Employee Engagement -There are challenges associated
- with employee engagement, hence the need to create a supportive, motivating and enabling environment to foster respect, loyalty and high performance in a learning organisation.
- d. Enterprise Systems -There is inefficiency in some administrative and academic procedures and processes.
- e. Work-readiness of Graduates - Some employers have indicated that the University should, inter alia, enhance co-curricular activities and introduce more internships to develop work-ready graduates.
- f. Strategy Alignment -Strategic objectives are set but are not properly aligned or adequately resourced.

## 4.3. OPPORTUNITIES

- a. Knowledge Economy Development - The University can continue to create and transfer knowledge to all sectors for regional and global impact.
- b. Emerging Industry Competencies - The need for highly skilled workers with new and diverse competencies (alternative energy, environmental management, digital technology, cultural entrepreneurship, sports management, etc.) presents an opportunity for the UWI.
- c. Emerging Markets - The emerging markets (e.g., Brazil, China, India and South Africa) provide opportunities for collaboration in areas such as teaching and research, student exchange/training and sharing of  technical and administrative expertise.

d.

Professional Development

- - Lifelong learning and continuing professional education provide the University with the prospect of leveraging knowledge to help bridge the gaps between the University and the private and public sectors and civil society .
- e. ICT Reach - The developments in ICT widen access and extend the UWI's
- capabilities to serve regional and global communities more flexibly and effectively .
- f. Enhancing Strategic Partnerships - The UWI is well-positioned to enhance strategic partnerships with other TLIs, knowledge networks, and the public and private sector in niche areas of research and development.
- g. Diversify Funding Base - The UWI can enhance partnerships with alumni, corporate and international donors, and philanthropic contributors to diversify funding base.
- h. Caribbean Knowledge
- - The University can tap into diasporic communities and other international communities and institutions to extend outreach programmes.
- i. Expand Regionally - Given its location, the UWI can look beyond its traditional markets to the non-Anglophone Caribbean and Latin America.
- j. Student Development -Collaboration with relevant stakeholders to nurture more socially responsible and committed students.
- k. Enrolment Sex Ratios - The shrinking demand for tertiary education by males can be addressed with creative strategies.

## 4.4. THREATS

- a. Funding - The 2008 global economic crisis further reduced (or delayed) some governments' funds and decreased the rate of receipt of  student tuition fees.
- b. Competition - The UWI faces erosion of  market share and funding because of  intense international and regional competition by public and private tertiary providers, resulting in increased difficulty in attracting high-quality students, staff  and faculty in selected areas. There has also been a significant growth in online and distance education by other educational providers.
- c. Intake Quality - The declining average student entrant scores will negatively affect the University's throughput and retention rates.
- d. Natural Disasters -Disruption of  operations as a result of  natural disasters.
- e. System and Communication Failure
- - Disruption of  operations as a result of  IT-related crashes,
- power surges and hacking.

## 6.0 VISION STATEMENT

The development of the UWI strategy begins with a statement of  strategic intent or vision. The Vision Statement provides stakeholders with a desired future state of  the University . The Vision Statement encapsulates a process of transformation and continuous achievement over time, while embracing change in the external dynamic environment.

Since the transformation theme, as stated in the UWI Strategic Plan 2007-2012, is a long-term process that can transcend short planning periods, the vision of the 20122017 Plan is basically the same as in the 2007-2012 Plan with minor amendments.

The Vision Statement of  the UWI is as follows:

By 2017, the University will be globally recognised as a regionally integrated, innovative, internationally competitive university, deeply rooted in all aspects of Caribbean development and committed to serving the diverse people of the region and beyond.

The Vision of  the UWI is further explained in the following context:

- · Globally recognised: A university acknowledged by its peers in the global higher education community as a leading contributor in research, teaching and learning, and knowledge creation on Caribbean, small state and developing country issues. Its global reach ensures partnerships and mutually beneficial relationships with international scholars; other universities, governments and institutions; international agencies; and public and private sectors worldwide.
- · Regionally integrated: The UWI is one of  two regional universities in the world, with campuses and centres in sixteen English-speaking Caribbean countries. The University is dedicated to providing the highest possible quality of  education and research while addressing the changing circumstances and needs of  the Caribbean region. As

a model for regional cooperation, the UWI remains responsive to regional and global developments. The UWI is recognised as a fully integrated regional University offering and promoting student mobility, credit transfer and the recognition of  qualifications to all regional and international students. It sees the whole University as being more effective than the sum of  the parts (campuses).

- · Innovative: Creation of  new knowledge and the ability to adapt the University's mission to changing environmental conditions and to be prepared to reinvent curricula to better prepare students to succeed in a global economy, as well as keeping pace with rapidly evolving technologies to ensure sustainability .

## KEY ATTRIBUTES OF THE UWI GRADUATE

The key attributes of  the UWI graduate, both undergraduate and postgraduate, refer to those academic abilities, transferable skills, personal and professional qualities that should be acquired by students during their time at the University, regardless of  their discipline of  study. These qualities, should, together enable a work-ready graduate.

These qualities will develop as a result of  interaction with lecturers, other staff  members, peers and the general community along with their personal and professional experiences. Developing these qualities enables all graduates to take on positive roles in society, and strengthens the region's intellectual and social capacities to explore new horizons in the interest of Caribbean development.

While these attributes are relevant to all students, it is expected that in the case of  the UWI postgraduate student, some attributes would carry more weight than others. For example, the postgraduate student would be expected to lead organisations and teams, set effective goals, and develop and apply sustainable outcomes for the overall benefit of  the external community. In addition, he/ she would have the ability to make significant and continuing contributions to research and new knowledge in his/her discipline.

A distinctive UWI graduate should demonstrate that he/she is:

- i. a critical and creative thinker
- ii. an effective communicator with good interpersonal skills
- iii. IT-skilled and information literate
- iv . innovative and entrepreneurial
- v. globally aware and well grounded in his/her regional identity
- vi. socially, culturally and environmentally responsible
- vii. guided by strong ethical values

The attributes of  the UWI graduate are further explained in the following context:

- · Critical and creative thinker: Graduates must be able to apply analytic thought and logical reasoning to a body of  knowledge and to clarify the assumptions, reasoning and evidence of  a specific issue and apply scientific principles. Key functions include generating alternative ideas, practices and solutions that are unique and effective, and exploring ways to confront complex and ambiguous problems and provide solutions.
- · Effective communicator with good interpersonal skills: Graduates must be able to make constructive contributions and communicate persuasively and appropriately in a range of  contexts and media. Graduates must have excellent interpersonal and decision-making skills to allow social interaction at all levels.
- · IT-skilled and information literate: Graduates should acquire both IT and information literacy skills, which are seen as essential parts of  a wider concept of  knowledge creation. An IT-skilled graduate is competent in the use of  computers and software to manage information. Information literacy is the ability to recognise when there is a need for information, and to be able to identify , locate, evaluate and effectively use that information to resolve an issue or problem in a range of  media.
- · Innovative and entrepreneurial: Graduates should possess a strong drive and leaning towards the creation and/or adaptation of  new ideas and products, with the intention of  creating new and sustained economic value.
- · Globally aware and well-grounded in his/her regional identity: Graduates must be aware of  their environment so that they are prepared for any eventuality that may affect their future or the environment of  which they are part. They must be aware of  global events and be knowledgeable and open-minded about political, social, economic, environmental and cultural issues; nationally , regionally and globally . The graduate must be willing to contribute to the political, cultural, social and economic development of his/her country and by extension, the Caribbean region.
- · Socially, culturally and environmentally responsible: Graduates must be able to acknowledge the social, cultural and environmental

implications of  their actions and be guided accordingly. He/she should recognise social justice issues with particular reference, but not limited, to his/her discipline and professional area.

- · Guided by strong ethical values: Graduates should champion respect, and understand and apply ethical practices and values personally and professionally in all aspects of  life.

## KEY ATTRIBUTES OF THE UWI EMPLOYEE

The performance of all employees is critical to the realisation of  the mission and vision of  the University . They must be able to respond, at short notice, to national, regional and global issues threatening the University's and region's future. Employees must adapt quickly to change and must see themselves as strategic stakeholders and agents of  change within the University.

Employees, both academic and non-academic, should possess specific attributes to efficiently and effectively carry out their duties. These attributes would apply differentially to employees according to their discipline or sphere of responsibility .

The UWI employee should demonstrate the following attributes:

- i. Job-related knowledge and skills
- ii. Critical and creative thinking skills
- iii. Responsible attitude to work-life balance
- iv . Institutional loyalty and engagement
- v. Positive customer service
- vi. Respectful and ethical behaviour

Personal and professional development is explained in the following context:

- · Job-related knowledge and skills: Employees should demonstrate a systematic or coherent understanding of  an academic/administrative/ service field of  study .
- · Critical and creative thinking skills: Employees should be able to apply analytic thought and logical reasoning to a body of  knowledge and to clarify the assumptions, reasoning and evidence of  a specific issue and apply scientific principles. Key functions include generating alternative ideas,

practices and solutions that are unique and effective, and exploring ways to confront complex and ambiguous problems and provide solutions.

- · Responsible attitude to work-life balance: This entails proper prioritising between career and ambition on the one hand, and health, pleasure, leisure, family and spirituality on the other. Applying this balance allows for a productive, committed and loyal employee and ensures an employee with a healthy lifestyle.
- · Institutional loyalty and engagement: Employees should understand and value their contribution to the strategic mission of  the University , which will be accomplished through fair and honest interaction with the assurance of  mutual benefits.
- · Positive customer service: Employees should possess exemplary interpersonal and communication skills and demonstrate a positive, motivated attitude to ensure that efficient quality services and products are delivered to students and other internal and external stakeholders in an environment conducive to university life. The University also promotes teamwork to ensure that ideas and talents are shared to solve complex problems that require creative and critical thinking.
- · Respectful and ethical behaviour: Employees should demonstrate courtesy and professional behaviour and embrace sound values in performing their duties, uphold the Code of  Ethics of  the University and promote the use of  professional ethics in all work activities.

## STRATEGIC PERSPECTIVES, THEMES, GOALS AND ASSOCIATED OBJECTIVES

## THE SIX CORE STRATEGIC PERSPECTIVES

The UWI 2012-17 Strategic Plan will utilise the BSC framework for linking its vision to its strategic goals and associated objectives. This framework will allow for the identification of  the different perspectives/dimensions of  the University's operations, the establishment of  causal relationships between the perspectives, and the specification of  strategic goals and associated strategic objectives, along with strategic actions/initiatives and a measurement system for achieving the vision of  the University . The six Perspectives adopted by the UWI in this Strategic Plan are as follows:

- i. Financial
- ii. Employee Engagement and Development
- iii. Internal Operational Processes
- iv . Teaching, Learning and Student Development
- v. Research and Innovation
- vi. Outreach (National and Regional Development; Internationalisation; Marketing and Communication; and Alumni Engagement)

Each Perspective is divided into 'Themes,' each with its explanatory Strategic Goals and associated Objectives.

## 10.1. PERSPECTIVE 1: FINANCIAL

The Financial Perspective of  the UWI's operations has been a constant challenge across all three previous strategic plans. The central thrust is to fulfil the UWI's strategic intentions by broadening/diversifying the funding base, thus relying less on government support.

## THEME A:  INCOME SOURCE DIVERSIFICATION

Since the economic downturn of 2008, some governments have either been reducing subventions to the UWI or have been late in releasing promised disbursements. This unpredictability has affected daily operations and created some measure of  pressure to meet commitments. While governments would continue to provide the core funding of  the University, funding from other sources would be geared towards the expansion initiatives of  the UWI. Further income-enhancing

objectives are found in the other Perspectives (Internal Operational Processes; Teaching, Learning and Student Development; Research and Innovation; and Outreach).

GOAL: Reduce the reliance on government financial assistance and increase the contribution from other sources.

## Strategic Objectives:

- i. Increase the number of  feepaying programmes.
- ii. Increase income from increased enrolment of  international students.
- iii. Enhance the commercialisation of  the UWI's intellectual capital and the physical plant.
- iv . Increase philanthropic giving, external grant funding and sponsored research.

## THEME B:  RECAPITALISATION OF THE UWI

The University's capital base is in need of  restructuring to enhance its international competitiveness. The main thrust is to encourage more strategic partnerships, which would result in capital investment in the UWI in such areas as research, plant, institutional strengthening, or joint academic programmes. More private equity injections would be also desirable, especially for capital projects and outlays.

GOAL: Restructure the UWI's capital base toward operational independence, renewal and expansion.

## Strategic Objectives:

- i. Increase strategic partnerships that will produce investments in the UWI.
- ii. Create opportunities for equity injections into the University .
- iii. Articulate and adopt a new business model for increased competitiveness, innovation and institutional sustainability .

## THEME C:  EFFICIENCT RESOURCE UTILISATION

The University must strive to increase the utilisation of  all resources while being environmentally friendly ('green') and creating or enhancing shared ICT environments and services. Resources from cost-saving measures can be thought of  as a 'new income stream' that can be reallocated to priority strategic areas.

GOAL: Introduce systems to promote a culture of greater efficiency and accountability in resource use.

## Strategic Objectives:

- i. Develop and implement a green university policy .
- ii. Rationalise procurement practices to achieve cost savings.
- iii. Increase the use of  outsourcing
- for selected activities.
- iv . Match human resource deployment with workloads.
- v. Leverage ICT to generate financial efficiencies over time.

## 10.2. PERSPECTIVE 2: EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT

The 'Employee Engagement and Development' Perspective is a realisation that engages both academic and non-academic employees, and is an essential ingredient of  strategic performance management and success. This perspective contains three themes.

## THEME A:  COMPETENCY-BASED DEVELOPMENT

The development of a competencybased framework will facilitate the identification of  gaps in employee competences and the creation of  staff development plans to address those deficiencies.

GOAL: Improve leadership and management capabilities and job competencies of all employees so that they can effectively fulfil their roles.

## Strategic Objectives:

- i. Develop an employee competency framework to inform recruitment and
- talent management, training, promotion, compensation and succession planning for staff development and to support the attributes of  the UWI employee.
- ii. Introduce training in leadership and management for all levels of  staff  as part of  talent management and career development planning

## THEME B:  CULTURE OF EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT

'Employee Engagement' represents a 'pull' instead of  'push' dynamic in getting employees involved with their work. Amongst the many factors driving engagement are meaningful work, having supportive supervision that models progressive behaviour, self-motivation and development, opportunities for learning, supportive work systems, incentives and a positive workplace climate.

GOAL: Create an organisational environment that promotes personal growth and development for employees and positive cognitive, emotional and behavioural states directed toward optimum organisational outcomes.

## Strategic Objectives:

- i. Improve the quality of  working conditions to enhance employee confidence and engagement and promote work/life balance.
- ii. Promote occupational,

- environmental health and safety and security in the workplace.
- iii. Realign/introduce incentive systems to reward high performance and innovation.
- iv . Develop a gender policy for the UWI to create a supportive environment for both men and women in all aspects of university life.
- v. Assess the degree of  employee engagement and development.

## THEME C:  STRENGTHENING PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS

The main purpose of the Human Resource (HR) Department is the strategic management of organisational performance through people management and development. It requires the transformation of  HR from a transactional to a more strategic/ transformational role that enables growth and productivity, facilitates employee development, and reinforces the competencies of  all employees. To that end, all HR systems must be realigned and upgraded to maximise human performance.

## GOAL: Improve, upgrade and align all HR Systems.

## Strategic Objectives:

- i. Establish service level agreements, measurements and reporting systems for all

- administrative professional and technical services.
- ii. Upgrade the human resource function to a strategic level within the University.
- iii. Align and upgrade the University's 'organisational capital' systems.

## 10.3. PERSPECTIVE 3: INTERNAL OPERATIONAL PROCESSES

The Internal Operational Processes Perspective looks at the critical organisational activities and processes that impact on the quality of  service that the University provides to its various stakeholders.

## THEME A:  EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSES

Academic and administrative processes must be reviewed and revised where necessary to ensure operational efficiency and a high level of  stakeholder satisfaction. The Single Virtual University Space (SVUS) is viewed as an enabling, seamless cyber platform allowing increased and enhanced access and service level, regionally and globally. It will create one technologically and operationally integrated university in both academic and administrative domains, and will facilitate the strengthening of  intercampus relationships and decisionmaking structures.

GOAL: Re-engineer academic and administrative operational processes and procedures to make them simpler, more transparent, efficient, and effective to achieve optimal stakeholder satisfaction within and across campuses.

## Strategic Objectives:

- i. Map current processes and develop a master plan for reengineering and integrating all processes/procedures across the University via benchmarking.
- ii. Enable cutting-edge technology to drive the re-engineering of all relevant administrative and academic processes across all campuses using University-wide systems.
- iii. Implement the SVUS plan and further enhance the Single Virtual Library Space (UWILinC).
- iv . Align administrative systems to be more customer-friendly and, in particular, to address the needs of  all staff  and students.

## THEME B:  GOVERNANCE ARRANGEMENTS

To restructure its financial base and attract new investors to offset decreasing government contributions, the UWI must revise its governance structure. It also needs to become a more intentional, intelligent, information-driven, evidence-based organisation to strengthen the decision-making process.

GOAL: Integrate improved governance systems into the UWI's operations.

## Strategic Objectives:

- i. Refine the UWI's governance mechanisms to allow for more effective and efficient decision making, greater responsiveness, transparency and accountability.
- ii. Develop systems for receiving and incorporating stakeholder input/voice.
- iii. Develop University strategies and initiatives for information, communication and marketing that are technology driven and achievable.

## THEME C:  MANAGEMENT STRUCTURES

Once a strategic business model and realigned governance structure are in place, they will provide the framework for management structure improvements to improve the quality and speed of  decision making.

GOAL: Improve the effectiveness of executive and senior management structures at campus and University levels.

## Strategic Objectives:

- i. Streamline management committees and structures with specific terms of  reference, timelines and authority.
- ii. Establish and maintain an

- online repository of  all major approved regulations, major policies and key decisions for improved internal communication.
- iii. Develop and implement a Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Plan across the University .

## 10.4. PERSPECTIVE 4: TEACHING, LEARNING AND STUDENT DEVELOPMENT

The Teaching, Learning and Student Development Perspective focuses on enhancing academic quality to support the development of  the key attributes of  the UWI graduate. This perspective also involves improving the total student experience, and open and distance education services.

## THEME A:  ACADEMIC QUALITY

Academic quality is vital for preparing the UWI graduate with the key attributes necessary for the modern work environment. It encompasses enhancing quality assurance, teaching quality and learning effectiveness.

## GOAL: Ensure excellence of academic processes.

## Strategic Objectives:

- i. Improve and harmonise quality assurance practices and processes across campuses.

- ii. Increase accredited undergraduate and postgraduate programmes across all campuses.
- iii. Promote continuous curriculum renewal aligned to the attributes of  the UWI graduate in order to develop the skill set necessary for success in the modern workplace.
- iv . Promote competency-based activities linked to the attributes of  the UWI graduate to the needs of  the workplace and society .
- v. Increase our ability to recruit and retain high-quality staff  and students.
- vi. Deepen the integration of faculties through curriculum development, joint research projects and cross-campus mobility of  staff  and students, and provide access to courses via the use of  ICT .

## THEME B:  STUDENT ENGAGEMENT AND EXPERIENCE

GOAL: To provide a high-quality student experience as a platform for enhanced regional and international student success and long-term commitment to the UWI.

## Strategic Objectives:

- i. Strengthen academic, administrative, financial and other student support services.
- ii. Enhance learning effectiveness by providing students with a more diverse, flexible and multidisciplinary teaching/ learning experience.
- iii. Strengthen co-curricular engagement and programmes.

## THEME C:  OPEN AND DISTANCE EDUCATION

An expansion of  all programmes available for full online delivery will increase enrolment in catchment areas and provide a platform for the global market. Blended learning, besides improving the quality of  instruction, will free up physical classroom space thus reducing the need for additional capital expenditures on physical infrastructure. As the UWI moves toward a SVUS, it must internally integrate all online offerings so that it appears externally as one seamless regional university.

GOAL: Provide multiple, flexible paths for all constituencies to pursue tertiary education over their lifetime.

## Strategic Objectives:

- i. Expand enrolment and opportunities for international,
- professional, non-degree and disadvantaged populations through the blended learning educational initiative.

- v. Implement the appropriate governance arrangements to support collaborative working relationships between the Open Campus and the residential campuses.
- vi. Strengthen and expand the scope, services and offerings of  the Open Campus to the communities it serves.

## 10.5. PERSPECTIVE 5: RESEARCH AND INNOVATION

Research and innovation is one of the key areas in which the University can distinguish itself  from its competitors and enhance its international reputation. It is therefore imperative to strengthen support systems to foster cutting-edge research and innovative outputs from faculty and postgraduate students. Commercialisation of cuttingedge research will also provide an additional revenue stream and improve visibility of  the UWI's research.

## THEME A:  FACULTY-LED RESEARCH AND INNOVATION

The goal of this theme focuses on developing the fifteen major research clusters:  Agriculture and Food Security; Biodiversity and Environmental Protection; Biotechnology , Climate Change and Sustainable Development; Competitiveness; Crime, Security and Justice; Cultural and Entertainment Industries;  Governance and Management of the Caribbean Sea; Health and Wellness; Integration Studies and the CSME; International Trade and the EPA; Natural Hazards Management; Renewable Energy; Sustainable Tourism, Small Island Developing States (SIDS); and Education. As the environment changes, the UWI will respond by being relevant to the needs of  stakeholders and their current issues and, as such, new clusters or areas within the existing clusters will be added. There is a need to highlight our research and its impact externally , especially for national and regional governments and the international community .

GOAL: Create an enabling environment to support, foster and increase the output of high research and innovation with an emphasis on the Caribbean.

## Strategic Objectives:

- i. Develop and implement supportive policies, processes

- and incentives for research.
- ii. Promote research accomplishments locally and internationally.
- iii. Increase the number of  peerreviewed publications and citations.
- iv . Develop market products based upon cutting-edge research.

## THEME B:  GRADUATE STUDIES AND STUDENT RESEARCH

Supporting a knowledge-based economy requires more postgraduate students with skills, knowledge and research expertise. Current data indicate that the throughput times to complete degrees are excessive and need to be monitored while adjusting systems where bottlenecks occur.

GOAL: Enhance graduate studies and increase postgraduate research output.

## Strategic Objectives:

- i. Increase enrolment of  full-time graduate research students.
- ii. Improve throughput of research students.
- iii. Strengthen supervision and other support systems and policies
- iv . Establish and implement mechanisms for measuring output and disseminating student research.

## THEME C:  FUNDING AND PARTNERSHIPS

GOAL: Increase funding and strengthen research partnerships.

## Strategic Objectives:

- i. Rationalise and enhance support for the development of  research proposals, implementation and management of research grants
- ii. Explore and increase donor funding for research and innovation.
- iii. Expand the range of strategic private and public sector partnerships, locally , regionally and internationally.

## 10.6. PERSPECTIVE 6: OUTREACH (NATIONAL AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT; INTERNATIONALISATION; MARKETING AND COMMUNICATION; AND ALUMNI ENGAGEMENT)

As a regional university , the UWI is mandated to serve the developmental needs of  all countries in the region through its outreach activities. The University will use internationalisation as a mechanism to advance key institutional objectives in the global arena. In order to facilitate outreach and internationalisation, marketing &amp; communications and alumni engagement across the globe will be a critical success factors.

## THEME A:  NATIONAL AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT

The UWI will continue to strengthen its regional character, relevance and impact by increasing its focus on policy making and addressing underserved educational and research needs in all countries across the region, particularly in the UWI-12+1 countries. This will be in keeping with the enduring mission of  the UWI.

GOAL: Become the driving force in assisting with the fulfilment of the economic, social, educational and other critical developmental needs of the region.

## Strategic Objectives:

- i. Develop a plan to link UWI expertise in research, services and programmes to better serve the needs of  the UWI-served nations, in particular the UWI12+1.
- ii. Execute identifiable priority projects using staff  and students from the UWI region-wide for community engagement.
- iii. Enhance the knowledge-base capacity of  major governmental agencies, regional private sector organisations, boards of  regional organisations and governing bodies of  TLIs with the UWI expertise.
- iv . Establish the Office of  Regional and International Affairs within the Vice Chancellery to develop a comprehensive and cohesive approach and a governance structure to optimise internationalisation and regionality.

## THEME B: INTERNATIONALISATION

The UWI's response to the forces of globalisation not only includes attracting students and faculty , but also creating the means of attraction. The new courses/programmes are addressed in the Teaching, Learning and Student Development Perspective and the research 'attraction' is explained in the Research and Innovation Perspective.

## GOAL: Enhance the global reach and impact of the UWI.

## Strategic Objectives:

- i. Attract quality international students and faculty.
- ii. Establish a physical UWI presence in selected countries outside of  the region to strengthen the ability of  the UWI to advocate effectively with external agencies and other stakeholders, including the Diaspora.
- iii. Improve the ranking of  the UWI within the top world ranking systems, with specific reference to niche and size.

## THEME C:  MARKETING AND COMMUNICATION (M&amp;C)

M&amp;C is critical for projecting the UWI image to support goals in internationalisation, national and regional engagement, research, recruitment of students and faculty , and to increase support from stakeholders, especially governments and private sectors. M&amp;C operations need to be regionally strengthened and to be seen as part of  strategic management.

GOAL: Present a unified brand image for the UWI aligned with its strategic vision and initiatives.

## Strategic Objectives:

- i. Define the UWI brand and
- create a marketing plan that will drive internal and external communications and marketing programmes.
- ii. Develop a common universitywide approach to M&amp;C operations.
- iii. Enhance the UWI presence in social media network.
- iv . Cooperate with internal stakeholders to enhance the UWI's global presence.
- v. Market the UWI Brand internationally and within the region.

## THEME D:  ALUMNI ENGAGEMENT

The UWI's alumni body remains an underutilised resource for furthering institutional goals. Deliberate programmes must be designed and implemented, not only to obtain monetary support but also to tap into this source of  intellectual capital to advance the development of  the University and the region.

GOAL: Facilitate the UWI development through alumni advocacy and structured involvement in the UWI and campus life.

## Strategic Objectives:

- i. Facilitate alumni involvement in teaching, research, programme development, internships/
- employment and mentorship.
- ii. Build a culture of  giving back to the alma mater through the development of programmes implemented during the student's life on campus, e.g., UWI STAT (The University of the West Indies Students Today, Alumni Tomorrow).
- iii. Improve the alumni database for more effective alignment and communications.
- iv . Strengthen and adequately fund all alumni offices, regionally and internationally.

## 11.0

## I MPLEMENTATION FRAMEWORK

This section sets out the strategies and actions required to execute the Strategic Plan and measure progress towards meeting the Strategic Goals. The UWI Strategic Plan 2012-2017 reflects an inclusive and integrated process of strategic planning. The five-year strategic planning cycle outlines strategic goals and strategies that have been developed through widespread stakeholder involvement across all campuses. The Strategic Plan revolves around the overall Mission, Vision, and Goals and Objectives of the UWI. The Strategic Plan embodies a five-year prospect, which will be continuously monitored and evaluated. Its realisation will require the commitment and involvement of all members of the University community .

During implementation, a series of  strategies will be designed to move the UWI forward towards the accomplishment of its goals. The six perspectives identified in this Strategic Plan will be developed into a series of  two-year (biennial) Operational Plans, which will have at its core a system of  SMART objectives, activities, measures/indicators, targets, timelines, resource needs and responsibilities/accountabilities.

An integrated review process will be established through a series of annual reviews of Operational Plans and biennial reviews of the Strategic Plan. The six perspectives underpinning the strategic plan are expected to remain constant but opportunities and unforeseen events may mean that components of the plan would have to be revised accordingly . Progress will be monitored according to the alignment of objectives as reflected in meeting Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) targets. Necessary modifications will be made to strategies and success factors based on resources, successes and current conditions.

The success of the Strategic Plan will depend on making the implementation plan operational in a dynamic fashion, with regular monitoring of the University's progress in a transparent manner. The monitoring and evaluation of the Plan will be undertaken utilising the BSC framework. The BSC is a strategic planning and management system that is used to align university activities to the vision and strategy of  the organisation, improve internal and external communications, and

monitor organisation performance against strategic goals. It involves identifying operating perspectives; linking the vision of  the organisation to the specific perspective and developing causal links between perspectives; developing a framework that identifies objectives and initiatives matched to timelines and KPIs, thereby establishing accountability for all perspectives; and developing an incentive framework for goal achievement. Critical assessment of  performance will help the UWI maximise the returns to those who invest in the University , and to all whom the UWI serves.

The implementation strategy will also serve as a tool for organisational learning, communication, strategic change, and improvement; all in the context of  existing management processes.

The Executive Management Team (EMT) will have the overall responsibility for leading and supporting the implementation of major initiatives and areas of strategic focus, as well as primary oversight for the 2012-2017 Strategic Plan. Responsibility for coordinating the strategic initiatives within the different perspectives will be assigned to the various PVCs or other representatives of the University community working in teams to emphasise the integrated nature of the strategic planning framework which will be used. The UOPD will continue

to have primary responsibility for the monitoring and evaluation of the Plan and for providing technical support to various units.

In order to successfully achieve our transformational goals, an explicit implementation strategy is required. This implementation strategy will rely on a cluster of  approaches and initiatives and will include the following:

- i. The EMT will be the primary advisory and oversight entity for the Strategic Plan and will lead the way in ensuring buy-in by internal and external stakeholders of the vision and related strategic transformation of the University , which is at the core of the Strategic Plan. University leaders from the EMT will be appointed to oversee each of the perspectives.
- ii. Campus and Vice Chancellery Planning Groups would be appointed after consultation with the Campus Principals and Vice Chancellor. As teams, they will meet periodically to ensure that the Operational Plan is aligned to the strategic goals and objectives of the Plan, and will act in an advisory capacity to the Campus Principal and the VC to ensure successful implementation.
- iii. It will be a requirement for each campus and the Vice Chancellery to develop biennial operational plans by August 2012 and subsequently implement them. These Operational Plans will be linked to the budget cycle. Each of these Plans will comprise a system of SMART objectives, activities, measures/indicators, targets, timelines, resource needs and responsibilities/ accountabilities derived from the Strategic Plan. These Plans would involve all units and departments so that Heads and Deans would play an integral part in the operational aspects of the planning process (that is, a bottom-up approach).
- iv . A cluster of KPIs will be developed under each perspective by the UOPD, in consultation with key stakeholders (including units, departments, faculties, the Quality Assurance and Campus Planning Offices). The final set of KPIs will be used to monitor and evaluate the progress of implementation and the effectiveness of  the selected strategies. It is critical that these KPIs are consistent and comparable across campuses. Two dimensions of KPIs will be developed and monitored. The first will be the macro-level KPIs, which will measure overall
- impact, while the second set will be micro-level KPIs, which will track implementation progress at a unit/departmental level.
- v. Departments will be required to report on progress with implementation and key performance indicators each semester to the UOPD, which will provide feedback to EMT .
- vi. The Strategic Plan will be reviewed biennially and will be infused with a degree of flexibility to respond to changing circumstances in order  to make course adjustments, revise strategies and reallocate resources, if  and when necessary . Where appropriate, Executive Management will approve changes to goals, targets, strategies and the reordering of priorities as may be required
- vii. The UOPD will be responsible for the overall coordination, monitoring and evaluation of progress and for providing advisory services to the University . An electronic BSC information system will be developed to facilitate information management, data sharing and reporting. The Campus Planning Offices will also play a key role in the coordination, implementation and monitoring of the Plan, and will support the faculties/ departments in their activities on the respective campuses.

## 12.0 CONCLUSION

The UWI Strategic Plan 2012-2017 consolidates and refines the accomplishments of  the last five years of  the previous Plan in order to accelerate institutional improvement. The six perspectives-Financial; Employee Engagement and Development; Internal Operational Processes; Teaching, Learning and Student Development; Research and Innovation; and Outreach (National and Regional Development; Internationalisation; Marketing and Communication; and Alumni Engagement)-integrate the operations of  the UWI in order to enhance its contributions to the region and beyond. The six perspectives of  the Plan should be seen as inter-related and are important to the aspirational and transformative goals of  the University. The Strategic Plan which will guide the University for the next five years, seeks to define how the teaching, research and public service functions will be employed for the benefit of  its stakeholders.

Creating a strategic plan requires consensus and stakeholder buy-in around common perspectives. This Plan lays the foundation for developing operational plans at the campus and unit levels as well as building an effective strategy for implementation. This Plan must be treated as a living document, which should be adaptable in the course of  execution or in light of  changes in the environment.

Realising each of  the Perspectives detailed in the Strategic Plan will be dependent upon effective execution at all levels of  the University . This calls for the development of  clear metrics to monitor the implementation of  the Plan using the BSC framework. The importance of  robust data and developing a culture of  compliance with respect to reporting on KPIs cannot be overemphasised for the successful evaluation of  the Plan. Moreover, a culture of  mutual accountability at all levels and effective communication will serve as the framework for achieving our strategic goals. The implementation of  the Strategic Plan must become an integral part of  the fabric of  the institution, from the highest organisational levels down to each individual employee.

Successful implementation of  the Strategic Plan requires the following critical success factors specifically: (i) effective management and creative leadership at all levels of  the UWI; (ii) adequate human and financial resources and (iii) appropriate accountability mechanisms, which include monitoring and evaluation. But, more importantly, it requires (i) a shift in thinking and behaviour; (ii) buy-in from staff, through engagement, to implement the Plan; (iii) an adequate incentive system; (iv) a commitment to sharing and using the results of  institutional research for organisational improvement; (v) fully supportive units and staff  that grow along with the University; (vi) continued buy-in and support from external stakeholders; (vi) cross-campus collaboration; and (viii) an effective communications and information management system. The 'climate' continues to favour the UWI as the premier regional university in the face of  a rapidly evolving and increasing competitive tertiary education sector in the region.

As a regional institution the UWI is committed to regional development. The diverse and distributed strengths of  the University suggest that it has the potential to lead innovative and creative thinking in the region. The need for the campuses to be more integrated as one cohesive university to meet the needs of the region through its teaching, research and public service remains relevant and critical to regionality . As a 'learning organisation,' the whole organisation must be seen as being more effective than the sum of  the separate units/campuses.

The UWI must recognise national, regional and global trends and organise itself  across the Campuses to response to changes in a rapid/agile manner. This requires greater emphasis on the strengthening of  connections that are distributed across campuses and concretising the commonality of  purpose, thus retaining its regional institutional uniqueness. The six perspectives, when adopted fully, will chart a common pathway to support the vision of a single university, building on individual strengths and creating synergies within the whole.

The Plan is aligned with the emerging global trends in higher education, such as increasing importance of  knowledge; greater diversity of  learners; the need for sourcing alternative financing; the further impact of  globalisation; the continued impact of  internationalisation; demands of  national and regional stakeholders; and the continuing impact of  the ICT revolution. The most significant and important future trends that are likely to impact on the University are technology, contracting regional and global economy and access to funding, increasing oversight by government and funding agencies, changing

demographics, competition for student and faculty recruitment, and the provision of  innovative learning technologies and multidisciplinary programmes that meet present and future market needs.

The mission of  the Strategic Plan, when successfully achieved, will transform the UWI by 2017. In doing so, the UWI will have effectively attracted and retained quality faculty and students; attracted grant funding; produced cutting-edge research; maintained the accredited quality programmes; delivered innovative products and impacted on the corpus of  knowledge; influenced the development of  national and regional communities; and achieved a stronger position among its peer institutions and competitors.

By 2017, then, the UWI will be closer to realising its vision of  a university committed to excellence with a thirst for generating knowledge and educating the leaders of  tomorrow. It will have invested and built on its strengths in its areas of  competitive advantage thereby impacting positively on the region and beyond. The University will be driven by a culture of  engagement and inclusion and will have become more attentive to keeping students at the centre and focussed on academic excellence. Further, the UWI will have expanded access to knowledge and education to the region and beyond. It will have re-engineered its processes, resulting in increased productivity, and will have become an even more efficient and better steward of  its fiscal and physical resources. It will have met the challenges and emerged a stronger and more cohesive regional university with a global reach.
