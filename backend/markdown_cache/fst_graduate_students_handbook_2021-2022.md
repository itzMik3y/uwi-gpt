## Disclaimer

This  Graduate  Student  Handbook  has  been  compiled  to  improve  the communication between  staff and  students regarding postgraduate programmes,  that  is, both  the taught  and  research  higher  degree programmes offered within the Faculty.

The  programme  requirements  outlined  are  to  be  adhered  to  by  1) students enrolling in the Faculty for the 2021-2022 academic year; and 2) students who transferred into the Faculty for the 2021-2022 academic year.

Though  the  Faculty  worked  assiduously  to  present  the  most  updated information  in  the  Handbook,  students  should  communicate  with  their Departments/Centres for changes that possibly occurred after the publication of the Handbook.

## ABOUT THE FACULTY

We are pleased that you are considering studying with us in the Faculty of  Science  and  Technology  (FST)  at  The  University  of  the  West  Indies, Mona  Campus.  This  is  where  the  world  of  technology  meets  that  of experimental and applied science. We take our students on a journey to discover and increase their knowledge and understanding of the various disciplines under the guidance of prominent lecturers and researchers.

Teaching  in  the  FST  commenced  at  Mona  in  1949  with  students  in  the Departments  of  Botany,  Chemistry,  Mathematics,  Physics,  and  Zoology. The first eleven graduates appeared in 1952 and by 2000 over 9,000 graduates had been produced. Today, the Faculty is among the largest in the  University,  consisting  of  7  departments:  Biotechnology,  Chemistry, Computing,  Geography  and  Geology,  Life  Sciences,  Mathematics  and Physics.

In addition to undergraduate  teaching,  postgraduate  teaching  and research form an important aspect of the work of the Faculty. The Faculty offers  a  wide  range  of  MSc  programmes,  and  research  programmes towards MPhil and PhD degrees in all Departments. If you join us next year, you will find yourself part of a 3,000-strong student body enrolled in one of over 30 graduate degree programmes including Applied Data Science, Medical Physics, Information Technology, Management Information Systems, Environmental Sciences, Geography, Geology, Food Chemistry, Renewable Energy and Zoology.

Being  part  of  a  large  university  means  students  can  have  access  to numerous resources, internationally-recognized faculty, scholarships, student groups and  research opportunities. In fact, interdisciplinary research in the FST is greatly enhanced by extensive collaborations with national and worldwide partners including faculties and campuses within The University of the West Indies, other domestic, regional and international universities, research institutions, non-governmental organizations  and  government  ministries.  Faculty  and  graduate  students

have frequent opportunities for networking and interactions with local and global  cohorts  by  publication  of  research  in  scientific  journals  and presentation of abstracts at local and international conferences, consultations, meetings and discussion forums.

We now look forward to helping you make a difference in whatever field of study you decide to pursue.

Note: Students failing a component (coursework or exam) of a course but receiving an overall mark of 50 or more will be entitled to a grade of FC/FE. The Grade Descriptors provided clarify the standards embodied by each letter grade.

The major difference in the new graduate scheme as compared to the old is in the percentage grading bands. The current grading scheme for graduate courses is:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

## Description:

- 1 The GPA system will apply to PG Certificates, PG Diplomas, Master s ' and Professional Doctorates.
- 2 The grade point/percentage bands as shown in the Table 1 (Graduate Scheme) above should apply. These are identical with the bands for the undergraduate GPA.
- 3 The descriptors which apply for the relevant range of marks are attached in Appendix 1.
- 4 The Minimum GPA needed for a student to graduate is 2.00 (C).
- 5 All coursework done for graduate credit is also computed in the GPA.

- 6 A student who fails any element of a course that counts towards the final grade (whether coursework or final examination) will be deemed to have failed that course and will be assigned the grade FC or FE (Fail Coursework, Fail Exam), even if they obtain an overall mark of 50% or higher. A student who passes an element of a course but does not obtain an overall mark of 50 or higher, will fall into the grade category in the grade scale in alignment with the mark achieved i.e., F1, F2. F3.
- 7 Academic standing will be based on the Semester GPA.  If a student's Semester GPA falls below 2.0, the student will be given a warning in the first semester.  If the student's GPA falls below 2.0 for two consecutive semesters, the student will be 'required to withdraw'.
- 8 Distinction will be awarded on the basis of a Programme GPA of 3.70 (an A- average).
- 9 Merit will be awarded if the student's G PA Average is 3.00-3.69
- 10 Pass will be awarded for students whose GPA falls below the B+ average (i.e., 2.0-2.99).
- 11 Research Project will be considered another course and will NOT require Distinction scores separately for the project - for the overall distinction.
- 12 The new GPA system will only apply to newly admitted students. All continuing students will be assessed under the existing system and will not fall under the GPA system.
- 13 Departmental prerequisites should not impact on a student's GPA, and grading should be based on pass/fail. Non-GPA courses for each programme must be clearly indicated.
- 14 The GPA system will come into effect from academic year 20212022.
- 15 The Regulations requiring amendments in order to ensure conformity towards implementing GPA have been approved BGSR.

## RESEARCH DEGREES

A research degree in the Faculty of Science and Technology can be placed in two categories: Master of Philosophy and Doctor of Philosophy. These are higher degrees and are mainly research-based (either laboratory- or field-based research). They span a wide range of disciplines and are awarded on the basis of original research detailed in a thesis/dissertation.

## University Regulation 1.3

The Master of Philosophy (MPhil), Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) and MD shall be primarily research degrees and shall be awarded primarily on the basis of examination by thesis. Other requirements shall be as specified in the respective Faculties.

Through the MPhil and PhD programmes, students conduct research in conjunction with a supervisor, who is a faculty member and recognized scholar in a particular research field, or with a supervisory team of faculty and other experts in the relevant discipline. Original findings can be published before the award of the degree, with the publication becoming part of the final thesis, thus contributing to the dissemination of knowledge and to development.

## TAUGHT MASTERS

Many  of  the  taught  Masters'  Programmes  also  include  training  in  research methodology and students are required to submit a Project Report or Research Paper in partial fulfillment of the requirement for the award of the Degree.

## GENERAL ENTRY REQUIREMENTS

## Graduate Diplomas and Taught Masters Degrees

A minimum GPA of 2.5 or a Lower Second Class Honours degree or Equivalent qualification (as determined from transcripts).

## Master of Philosophy (MPhil)

## University Regulation 1.12

The minimum requirement for admission to MPhil programmes shall be a minimum GPA of 3.0, or an Upper Second Class Honours degree or its equivalent, unless the Campus Committee in any particular case otherwise decides.

Typical applicants would have a bachelor's degree in the particular discipline and would have achieved at least an upper second class honours to be considered for this category of programmes. Applicants are also expected to write a research proposal on the area or topic of interest. Acceptance into these programmes is also subject to the availability of a supervisor.

## Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)

## University Regulation 1.13

The minimum requirements for admission to PhD programmes:

- a) Approved graduate degrees awarded primarily for research;
- b) Taught Master's degree from The UWI or another approved University, provided that the Masters programme included a research component of at least 25% of the total credit rating and the applicant achieved at least a B+ average or its equivalent;
- c)
- Approval of upgrade application;
- d) Such other qualifications and experience as the Board for Graduate Studies and Research may approve.

## Applicants must have a Master of Philosophy or a Master of Science degree in

the particular discipline to be considered for this category of programmes. They are expected to write a research proposal on the area or topic of interest and will only be accepted if appropriate supervisors are available. Applicants should therefore prepare a statement of proposed research, indicating their intended topic and research strategy.

## PROGRAMME DURATION

| Programme            | Full-Time       | Part-Time       |
|----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Master of Science    | Two (2) years   | Three (3) years |
| Master of Philosophy | Three (3) years | Five (5) years  |
| Doctor of Philosophy | Five (5) years  | Seven (7) years |

## CHOOSING A RESEARCH TOPIC

If you decide to pursue a research degree, it is important that the thesis topic chosen be of genuine and sustainable interest. Investigate the current research being undertaken by members of staff of the relevant Department or Centre. Candidates may also contact possible supervisors to discuss proposed research projects. PhD applicants should prepare a statement of proposed research indicating their intended topic and research strategy.

## CREDIT REQUIREMENTS AND COURSES

Master of Philosophy (MPhil)

Requires the completion of six (6) credits from postgraduate courses (determined by department and programme) in addition to a thesis documenting the results of the research carried out over a period.

## Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)

Requires the completion of nine (9) credits from postgraduate courses (determined by programme and department) in addition to a thesis documenting the results of the research carried out over a period.

## Important Points to Note:

- · PhD candidates are required to have three (3) seminars on their transcript before they can submit their thesis for examination.
- · MPhil candidates are required to have two (2) seminars on their transcript before they can submit their thesis for examination.
- · Candidates who are upgrading their registration to the PhD are required to have at least one (1) seminar on their transcript before their upgrade seminar can be approved by the Office of Graduate Studies and Research.

- · The upgrade seminar can be considered as one of the Graduate Seminars as long as it is not the last seminar before the submission of the PhD thesis.

## CONFERENCES AND PRESENTATIONS

Students are encouraged to seek opportunities to present their work. Funding is available, through grants from the Office of Graduate Studies and Research, to attend  local  and  international  conferences  and  other  events  relevant  to  a student's research topic/area. In addition, there is a biennial conference organised  and  held  locally  by  the  Faculty  of  Science  and  Technology  and students  are  encouraged  to  submit  posters  and/or  oral  presentations  on  their work.

## UPGRADING OF REGISTRATION

With the exception of holders of MPhil degrees from recognised universities, a candidate for the PhD degree is normally required to register for the MPhil degree in the first instance. Applications for transfer to a PhD programme from MPhil are encouraged where students display exceptional promise. Candidates who are upgrading their registration to the PhD are required to have presented at least one (1) seminar before their upgrade seminar can be approved by the Office of Graduate Studies and Research.

## PHD TRANSFER PROCEDURE

A successful transfer to a PhD programme involves the satisfactory completion of a transfer seminar . The seminar includes a summary of the MPhil work to date, a presentation of results to date, and a proposal for extension of the work to PhD level.

## University Regulation 1.40

29. The procedure for upgrading of registration shall be as follows:

- a) The student should first consult his/her Supervisor and then write to the Senior/Assistant Registrar, through the Supervisor and the Head of Department/Unit or Director of Institute/Centre (hereafter "Head"), formally seeking an upgrade of his/her registration. The Dean of the Faculty or his/her nominee should be copied on all correspondence.
- b) The Senior/Assistant Registrar will seek a recommendation from the Head of Department, advising

- him or her of student's eligibility for the upgrade. The Dean should be copied on all correspondence.
- c) If the Head of Department is the student's Supervisor, he/she must delegate his/her responsibilities as Head in this process to a senior academic colleague in the Department/Institute/Centre/Unit.
- d) If the Head of Department is in agreement with the student's request to upgrade, he/she should consult with the student's Committee of Advisors, other Departmental colleagues and the Chair of the appropriate Faculty Committee to formulate an Upgrade Assessment Committee all normally chosen from the academic staff of the University

The Upgrade Assessment Committee shall comprise:

- i. the Chief Supervisor(s),
- ii. at least two independent Assessors, and iii. an independent Chair.

Assessors should therefore be chosen on the basis of their knowledge and experience at the appropriate level in the area of the student's research. One of the assessors may be drawn from outside the University community in the appropriate circumstances.

- e) The Head of Department shall submit the recommendations for the Upgrade Assessment Committee to the Chair of the Campus Committee for approval.
- f) Once approval has been given for the composition of the Upgrade Assessment Committee, the designated Chair shall ask the student to provide a copy of his/her Upgrade Proposal for each of the Assessors, and set a mutually agreed date for the oral presentation by the student of:
- i. his/her report on the work done and accomplishments to date under the MPhil registration;
- ii. his/her proposal to upgrade the work to the PhD beyond the MPhil level.
- g) If the Head of Department is not in agreement with the student's request to upgrade, he/she should submit comments on the matter to the Chair, Campus Committee, copying them to the Supervisor(s). The Chair, Campus Committee, will deliberate and decide whether to allow the upgrade to take place. If approval is not granted, the Senior/Assistant Registrar shall inform the student of the decision, copying the Head of Department and Supervisor(s).

- h) The precise form of material considered as part of the Upgrade Proposal will vary across Departments and disciplines so the student should draft the Upgrade Proposal in consultation with his/her Supervisor(s). The Upgrade Proposal should be no more than 100 pages. Whilst it is recognised that the exact nature of the Proposal submitted by the student will depend on the discipline, it should cover at least the following components (not necessarily as discrete items):
- i. An introduction giving the context of the work;
- ii. A literature review;
- iii. A research question and hypothesis;
- iv. A section on methodology;
- v. A substantial piece of work towards the thesis objectives;
- vi. A plan and timetable for the remainder of the work; and
- vii. A bibliography.
- i) The criteria for upgrade to PhD status include:
- i. Commitment to pursuing research at The UWI leading to the PhD degree;
- ii. Satisfactory progress in the work so far;
- iii. Demonstration of sufficient awareness of the context of the work and completion of such tasks as a review of relevant literature and a bibliography;
- iv. Ability to formulate a viable hypothesis or research question that could be completed within the normal time frame of the PhD programme;
- v. Satisfactory technical and generic skills development;
- vi. Formulation of a viable plan for the work; vii. Consideration of the research ethics dimensions of the project, and application for ethics approval from the relevant Research Ethics Committee if appropriate;
- viii. English Language proficiency, both written and spoken.
- j) The upgrade will consist of at least a 30-minute oral presentation of the work and proposal by the student, followed by questions posed to the student by the Assessors. After the presentation the Chair will meet with the Assessors to deliberate on whether the student has met the criteria as outlined.

- k) The Upgrade Assessment Committee is to recommend either:
- i. Pass -upgrade of registration to PhD; or
- ii. Adequate -subject to revision of the Upgrade Proposal to the satisfaction of the Supervisor within two (2) months; or
- iii. Inadequate -Revise and resubmit the Upgrade Proposal for second and final attempt at the upgrade seminar within six (6) months; or
- iv. Fail -MPhil to be completed within a specified time.
- l) The Chair of the Upgrade Assessment Committee shall prepare a written joint report on the outcome within two (2) weeks of the upgrade. This report is to be signed by all members and submitted to the Senior/Assistant Registrar for the deliberations of the Campus Committee.
- m) If the Upgrade Assessment Committee cannot reach a consensus, independent written reports must be prepared by the Chair and the Assessors each with a clear recommendation about the Upgrade and submitted to the Senior/Assistant Registrar.
- n) The Chair of the Campus Committee 'shall then submit the report(s) of the Upgrade Assessment Committee along with a recommendation to the Chair of the Board for consideration.
- o) The Senior/Assistant Registrar shall inform student of the decision of the Board, copying the Head of Department and Supervisor(s).

## AWARD OF DEGREE

For the award of the degree, the student submits a thesis or dissertation in an approved  format.  The  essential  difference  between  the  Master  and  Doctoral levels,  apart  from  the  length  of  the  registration  period,  lies  in  the  quality  of  a successful Ph.D. thesis. This must be judged to be the result of original research, to be an addition to knowledge, and to be worthy of publication either in full or in an abridged form.

The  award  of  a  Ph.D.  degree  also  requires  that  a  candidate  defends  his/her thesis at a public oral examination.

## DUTIES &amp; RESPONSIBILITIES OF STUDENTS AND SUPERVISORS

https://www.mona.uwi.edu/postgrad

## SUPERVISION

Each student receives guidance from an Advisory Committee that consists of a Supervisor, who is an expert in the area of research to be undertaken, and at least two other persons with related expertise.

The Board of Graduate Studies has issued the following guidelines for Graduate Studies regarding research. Please consult the Graduate Studies Guide for Students and Supervisors (at Office of Graduate Studies &amp; Research website above) for further details.

## RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE STUDENT

Graduate students have the following responsibilities:

- · keeping the schedule of meetings agreed with the supervisor;
- · taking the initiative in raising with the supervisor problems or difficulties, however elementary they may seem;
- · discussing the type of guidance and comments found most helpful;
- · maintaining good progress of work in accordance with the schedule agreed with the supervisor;
- · presenting written material as required in sufficient time to allow for comments and discussion before proceeding to the next stage;
- · making representation to the Head of Department (HOD) if an effective working relationship is not established with the supervisor or if, for reasons outside the student's control, the work is not proceeding satisfactorily.

## RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE SUPERVISOR

Supervisors have the following responsibilities:

- · giving guidance about the nature of research and the standard of performance expected, about the planning of the research programme, about literature and sources, about requisite techniques (including
- · arranging for instruction where necessary), and about attendance at classes;
- · advising the student of the nature of guidance or comments to be offered on the student's written work since comments have to be in accordance with the general principle that the work should be the student's own;

- · arranging regular tutorial meetings with the student;
- · being accessible to the student at other times as the need arises;
- · giving detailed advice on the completion dates of successive stages of the work so that the whole may be submitted within the scheduled time;
- · requesting written work as appropriate and returning such work with constructive criticism in reasonable time;
- · arranging for the student to present the work to staff or graduate seminars, in oral or written form;
- · arranging for the student to have practice in oral examination;
- · ensuring that the student is made aware of inadequacy of progress or of standards of work below that generally accepted;
- · paying particular attention to overseas students (especially those from outside the Caribbean) who may in the early stages need very frequent contact, and often advice of a seemingly elementary kind;
- · submitting full annual reports to the Board for Graduate Studies, through the Campus Registrar, on the student's progress. If the student is making insufficient progress or the work is below standard, the supervisor should recommend whether the student should be allowed to continue;
- · reminding the student to act in accordance with University regulations governing entry to the thesis examination (normally three months before the expected date of submission of the thesis);
- · making recommendations to the Head of Department on the nomination of the examiners of the student's thesis/research paper/project report, (normally three months before the expected date of submission);
- · ensuring that the final work of the student satisfies accepted standards of usage for scholarly writing and that the presentation conforms to the University's General Regulations.

## RESEARCH ETHICS GUIDELINES

https://www.mona.uwi.edu/mcrec

## BACKGROUND

- · The  guidelines  are  intended  to  assist  researchers  in  understanding  the ethics review process for the Faculty of Science and Technology (FST).
- · These guidelines are not intended to be comprehensive and should not be viewed  as an independent document. Faculty research ethics guidelines are subsumed under the UWI Mona Campus Research Ethics policy  (https://www.mona.uwi.edu/mcrec)  and  based  on  the  proposal guidelines  for  graduates  and  academic  staff  provided  by  the  UWI Mona  Campus  Research  Ethics  Committee's  Rese arch  Proposal  Toolkit (https://www.mona.uwi.edu/mcrec).
- · Ethical approval of research by the UWI Mona Campus Research Ethics Committee  (MCREC)  is  devoted  to  the  assessment  of  the  research process.    The  review  procedures  will  assist  researchers  in  conducting quality research that adheres to the highest ethical standards.  Ethical review  is  designed  to  promote  responsible  research  that  protects  the participants, the integrity of the UWI and the researcher(s).
- · Any procedures involving human subjects, that may include surveys and questionnaires, focus groups and interviews, observations etc., are to be conducted with the informed consent of participants and with protection of participants' rights and their knowledge of the level of risk involved.
- · The  principles  of  research  ethics  ask  that  researchers  avoid  harming participants,  by  respecting  individuals  and  taking  into  account  their needs, interests and rights. It is expected that benefits of the research outweigh the risk to participants.  Furthermore, research is built on trust. There should therefore not only be trust that the findings  reported  by researchers  are  valid,  representative  and  accurate,  but  also  that  the rights of the participants are respected and protected.

## THE FST RESEARCH ETHICS COMMITTEE

- · The  Faculty  of  Sciences  and  Technology  is  mandated  to  establish  a Research  Ethics  committee  comprised  of  representatives  from  each Department and Centre.
- · The FST Research Ethics Committee operates as a sub-committee under the UWI  Mona Campus Research Ethics Committee (please see https://www.mona.uwi.edu/mcrec)

- · Applications will normally be reviewed at specially scheduled meetings of the FST  sub-committee  following their receipt from  supervisors (directly)  or  from  the  UWI  Mona  Campus  Research  Ethics  Committee (low-risk expedited review).
- · It is important  to  note  that  it  is  the  responsibility  of  the  principal investigator  or  supervisor  to  submit  proposals  directly  to  the  main committee after review by the faculty sub-committee; thus assuming full responsibility for the ethical approval of their research.

## REVIEW OF PROPOSAL

There are three possible levels of review (details available online at https://www.mona.uwi.edu/mcrec)  and  researchers  may  indicate  in  the  cover letter under which their proposal would fall. N.B. All moderate, high risk and PhD proposals require full committee review.

- a. Full/Convened Committee Review
- b. Minimal risk proposal (which include expedited)
- c. Review for Exemption Status

## ROLE OF THE COMMITTEE

The expanded role of the FST Research Ethics Committee includes the following:

- 1. To review proposals generated by FST Faculty and Graduate Students so as to provide feedback and ensure that the submission to the UWI Mona  Campus  Research  Ethics  committee  (MCREC)  is  as  seamless  as possible.
- 2. To  review  minimal  risk  proposals  which  are  directed  to  the  FST  Ethics Committee  by  the  UWI  Mona  Campus  Research  Ethics  Committee (MCREC) and give approval/feedback to the UWI MCREC.
- 3. In cases where the UWI MCREC provides feedback on a proposal and the researchers require clarifications, the FST sub-committee is available to meet and discuss the concerns by appointment.
- 4. The  subcommittee  is  also  available  for  consultation  with  any  staff  or student, by appointment.

## OBTAINING ETHICAL APPROVAL

All persons conducting research involving humans and other animals MUST seek ethical approval PRIOR to the start of field work or data collection.

Students  whose  research  requires  ethical  approval  are  advised  to  initiate  the process as soon as they have written their research proposal and at least 3 months before they plan to start data collection/surveys. The application is actually made by the Supervisor (with the student named as co-applicant) or by the Principal Investigator where there is no graduate student involvement.

## THE ETHICS REVIEW PROCESS

- 1. Complete a research proposal to the satisfaction of supervisor/supervisory  committee/Principal  Investigator.    This  must  be inclusive of  questionnaire(s),  list of  focus  group  questions  or  other documents  to  be  used  to  gather  data  from  human  subjects. N.B. copyrighted  instruments  must  be  accompanied  by  a  letter/e-mail granting permission for use.
- 2. Download the Research Ethics Toolkit (Ethics proposal requirements) from link #3 below.
- 3. Provide all documents as guided by the toolkit, that is:
- a. Cover letter
- b. Summary/abstract
- c. Proposal
- d. Checklist
- e. Consent forms
- f. Letters of support from partner agencies/departments (where needed)
- g. Project budget
- h. Appendices (questionnaires etc.)
- 4. Proposal must be submitted online following the instructions in the applicant manual (see link below).

## UNIVERSITY REGULATIONS ON PLAGIARISM

## DEFINITION of plagiarism (in these Regulations)

'Plagiarism' means the unacknowledged and unjustified use of the words, ide as or creations of another, including unjustified unacknowledged quotation and unjustified unattributed borrowing.

## CATEGORIES OF PLAGIARISM AND ASSOCIATED PENALTIES

- · Level One cases are those in which only small quantities of the work is affected, and in which the breaches are minor. They therefore include borderline situations, cosmetic paraphrasing, negligent referencing or a few incorrect or missing citations.
- ▪ In the case of written papers and project reports, Level One Plagiarism, if substantiated, shall result in a deduction of marks. Resubmission after appropriate correction, as an educational opportunity for the student, may be required.
- ▪ In the case of theses, Level One Plagiarism, if substantiated, shall result in return of the submitted work to the student for revision and resubmission. Resubmission in this situation will not be regarded as a failure.
- · Level Two cases are those which involve extensive plagiarism, with clear indication of academic dishonesty. They include situations where a significant amount of material is borrowed or directly quoted or cosmetically paraphrased with no attribution at all, or attribution insufficient to indicate that the borrowed material is not the work of the student.
- ▪ For written papers and project reports, a student found guilty of Level Two Plagiarism shall, at a minimum, receive a grade of zero. Depending on the severity of the offense, such a student could also receive a grade of zero for the course or could be expelled from the University, with or without the possibility of re-entry.
- ▪ Theses in which Level Two Plagiarism has been substantiated shall be treated as 'inadequate' (see Regulations for Graduate Diplomas and Degrees, Section 3, Reg. 26), which permits resubmission of the revised thesis for examination within eighteen months of the date of notification; or, if the offense is particularly severe shall result in expulsion.

For full details consult the University Regulation on Plagiarism (Graduate Diplomas and Degrees) and Policy on Graduate Student Plagiarism document available on the Office of Graduate Studies &amp; Research website at: http://www.mona.uwi.edu/postgrad/

## MASTER OF SCIENCE: NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

## PROGRAMME OVERVIEW

There are three M.Sc. Degree and Diploma streams in the NRM:

- · Integrated Urban and Rural Environmental Management (IUREM)
- · Disaster Risk Management (DRM) and
- · Marine and Terrestrial Ecosystems (MaTE).

The  M.Sc.  degree  consists  of  a  common  core  of  six  courses,  plus  specific specialization courses for each stream, and a major Research Project.

## Programme Objectives

The M.Sc. NRM-IUREM commenced in September 1998. It is coordinated by the Centre for Environmental Management and was initially supported by funds from the European Union. The primary objective of the programme is to contribute to an  integrated  approach  in  the  Caribbean  region  by  training  professionals  in environmental and natural resource management.

The M.Sc. NRM-DRM  commenced  in  September  2009.  The  focus  of this programme is on the training of disaster management personnel from different disciplines, and the development of policy to address regional disaster management.

The M.Sc. NRM-MaTE is the result of a 2008 merger of the Aquatic Sciences and Tropical  Ecosystem  Assessment  and  Management  M.Sc.  programmes,  and  is coordinated in conjunction with the Department of Life Sciences. The programme investigates selected aspects  of the biodiversity associated  with Jamaican aquatic and terrestrial environments, with a greater emphasis on their management, conservation and sustainable use.

## Entry Requirements

- · For the M.Sc. IUREM and DRM BSc. Honours degree in earth sciences, geography, geology, environmental science, social sciences or a relevant or analogous area from a recognized university.
- · For the M. Sc. MaTE BSc. Honours degree in biological sciences from a recognized university.

## Duration of Programme

- ▪ Two years and two summer periods.  This excludes time taken for examination of the project.
- ▪ Candidates will be required to register Research Project 'incomplete' (Exams Only) in September (Semester 1) following submission of the project in August (Summer Semester); and in January (Semester 2) after submitting the project in November (Semester 1).

## PROGRAMME STRUCTURE

The programme is delivered using a variety of mechanisms including face-to-face lectures,  seminars,  tutorials,  field  trips  and  a  research  project.    It  also  includes project  and  scenario-based  workshops,  case  studies  and  assignments  in  which group work and student-centred learning approaches will be used. Students will be encouraged to take responsibility and control of their own learning. This will culminate in the final research project in which students will be responsible for the conduction and reporting of a project with the assistance of a supervisor who is an expert in the chosen area.

The  programme  is  taught  full-time  with  the  delivery  of  lectures/tutorials  and seminars (two evenings per week) from 5:30 to 8:30p.m. Laboratory sessions and Field trips occur on a Friday or Saturday.

## BIOL6550 ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH PROJECT

(12 Credits) (Semesters 3&amp;4: 20 weeks commencing in the Summer)

Anti-requisite: May not be taken with ENVR6500

## Course Description

Students will prepare potential topics for their Research project  during the first semester of the M.Sc., based on initial ideas for their research project. Potential projects may be suggested for those students who do not have a specific topic in mind. During the first two semesters, the student will further develop the research project  idea  and  clear  aims  and  objectives.  This  will  enable  supervisors  to  be identified  for  respective  projects  and  to  guide  the  progress  of  the  research thereafter.

The research project may cover any feasible aspect of environmental management (IUREM)  and  management  of  tropical  biodiversity  (MaTE).

- · Offer a programme that will attract increased interest, by introducing specializations and courses that address current and future needs of the industry.
- · Establish a  framework  and  programme  structure  that  will  flexibly facilitate evolution of the programme without compromising any of the programme objectives.
- · Strengthen  the  core  of  the  programme  by  defining  a  core  that  can support a broad set of specializations in Computer Science.
- · Introduce  a  framework  that  allows  candidates  who  have  completed their degrees at various times in the past, who may not have completed the  current  requirements  of  an  undergraduate  degree  in  Computer Science, to be brought to the same level of competence before pursuing advanced courses in Computer Science.

## Entry Requirements

Applicants must possess a first degree with a major in  a recognised Computing discipline from a recognised university.

## Duration of Programme

The  programme is  duration  24  months  (part-time)  inclusive  of  time  needed  for completion of the major Research Project

## PROGRAMME STRUCTURE

The degree shall consist of 40 Credit Hours (not including any courses taken to fulfill background requirements), as follows:

The degree consists of a core (12 credits), advanced elective courses in a number of specialized areas of Computer Science (20 credits), and a research project (8 credits).

The core cover key academic and practical areas of CS, being both a subset and an  intersection  of  areas  considered  to  be  of  prime  relevance  to  national  and regional needs as well as those deemed necessary globally (as recognized  by the  ACM/IEEE  and  other  bodies).  The  core  consists  of  two  parts:  firstly,  two Computer  Science  courses,  and  secondly,  a  general  requirement  designed  to ensure that the candidate has the necessary technical writing and research skills necessary to pursue the degree and to pursue research in industry or academia.

Candidates will be able to choose from elective courses from a number of areas of specialization in  Computer Science in order to allow them to bring together knowledge and skills from multiple specializations. This flexibility is important in meeting the demands of modern industry and contemporary research. However, they must choose at least two courses in one area of specialization in order to achieve depth in at least one area.

Finally, the research project course allows candidates who are pursuing a career in either industry or research to complete an in-depth project, with the option to emphasize either the industry-related or academic aspects of the project in the design of the project and the accompanying technical report. The report must be of publishable or professional quality.

## SWEN6310 MODEL-DRIVEN ENGINEERING

(4 Credits)

## Prerequisite

NONE

## Course Description

The key elements of a DSM solution are modelling languages, code generators and framework code. Models are built representing different views of a software system using different formalisms, i.e. modelling languages. The formalism is chosen in such a way  that  the  model  concisely  expresses  the  properties  of  the  system  that  are important at the current level of abstraction. During development,  high-level specification  models  are  refined  or  combined  with  other  models  to  include  more solution details, such as the chosen architecture, data structures, algorithms, and finally even  platform  and  execution  environment-specific  properties.  The  manipulation  of models is achieved by means of model transformations. Truly model-driven development uses automated transformations in a manner similar to the way a pure coding  approach  uses  compilers.  Once  models  are  created,  target  code  can  be generated  and  then  compiled  or  interpreted  for  ex ecution.  From  a  modeller's perspective, generated code is complete and it does not need to be modified after generation. This means, however, that the 'intelligence' is not just in the models but in the code generator and underlying framework.

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of this course students should be able to:

- · Explain the concepts, principles, and theories of MDE
- · Discuss the activities involved in MDE
- · Discuss the merits and challenges of MDE
- · Create a domain specific model for a small, well defined problem
- o create a domain specific modelling language
- o create an associated domain specific code generator
- o create an associated domain specific framework
- · Generate a solution from a DSM
- · Recommend when either an MDE or other contemporary software engineering approach should be used to solve particular problems

## Course Content

- 1. What is MDE
- a. raising the level of abstraction for the development of software solutions

- b. domains, languages, models, frameworks, generators, transformations
- 2. When should MDE be used
- 3. Domain-specific language development

## COURSE DESCRIPTIONS

## MATH6621 GENERAL TOPOLOGY

(4 Credits) (Semester 1)

## Course Description

Topology is the study of spaces and sets and can be thought of as an extension of geometry. It is an investigation of both the local and the global structure of a space or set. The foundation of General Topology (or Point-Set Topology) is set theory.  The motivation behind topology is that some geometric problems do not depend  on  the  exact  shape  of  an  object  but  on  the  way  the  object  is  put together.  The  course  gives  an  up-to-date  and  modern  overview  of  the  main concepts in General Topology. Topological properties and several examples of topological  spaces  arising  in  several  branches  of  mathematics  are  studied  to show how topology is a unifying theme in different mathematical fields.  A course in general topology is essential for enrolled students since it provides them with fundamental notions such as those of topological space, topological vector space, connectedness, and compactness.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

- 1. explain the characteristics of topological, metric and normed spaces;
- 2. discuss the implications of the cardinality of the continuum;
- 3. construct new  spaces  from  old,  including  subspaces,  quotients  and product spaces;
- 4. construct continuous functions between topological spaces;
- 5. test convergence of sequences in different spaces;
- 6. identify connections between modern analysis and topology;
- 7. discuss the consequences of Urysohn's lemma;
- 8. use examples to explain the significance of Tychonoff's theorem.

## MATH6623 NUMERICAL METHODS FOR DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

(4 Credits) (Semester 1)

## Prerequisite

NONE. Prior knowledge of Computer Programming would be an asset

## Course Description

Differential equations are abundant in the theoretical modelling of problems in science  and  engineering  as  well  as  economics,  social  science,  biology,  business, health  care,  etc.  Though  there  have  been  many  well-developed  analytical solution techniques available for hundreds of years, often the systems described by differential equations are so complex, or the systems that they describe are so large, that a purely analytical solution is not tractable.  It is in these complex cases that numerical methods are used to obtain an approximate solution of the differential equation. With high-speed computers and advancement in Numerical analysis and efficient computer programmes, one can tackle challenging problems in the above fields.

This  course  is  intended  to  introduce  and  give  an  understanding  of  numerical methods  for  the  solution  of  ordinary  and  partial  differential  equations.  The

methods will be derived and the convergence and stability of the methods will be analyzed. The applications of these methods in solving real world problems will be emphasized. Students will be exposed to modern mathematical software for the practical use of the problems and for better visualization of the convergence and stability of these methods.

## Learning Outcomes

On completion of this course, the student should be able to:

- 1. Develop  a  logical  mathematical  approach  to  solve  differential  equations and  solve  these  equations  using  numerical  methods  where  those  are required.
- 2. Investigate the occurrence of errors in different techniques developed in the course.
- 3. Analyze the convergence and stability of the methods of the study.
- 4. Write codes in available software to simulate numerical  methods  for  the differential equations and Understand visually basic computational aspects related to accuracy, stability and convergence of numerical methods.

## MATH6625 MEASURE AND INTEGRATION

(4 Credits) (Semester 1)

## Prerequisite

None

## Course Description

The construction of the Riemann integral is known to every undergraduate mathematics  student.  However,  this  integral  has  certain  inherent  limitations  that prevent  its  use  in  a  wide  range  of  mathematical  applications,  including  modern developments in the fields of probability theory, stochastic processes and dynamical systems.  This  issue  is  dealt  with  by  extracting  the  fundamental  ideas  behind  the construction  of  such  integrals,  and  providing  a  mathematically  rigorous,  though abstract, foundation upon which to define more powerful notions of integration.

This course is intended to develop the ability of students to work with abstract ideas.

## CORE COURSES

## MTRM6010 RISK CATEGORIZATION &amp; IDENTIFICATION

(3 Credits) (Semester 1)

## Prerequisite

None

## Course Description

Traditional risk management approaches are typically done on a silo basis. What has generally  been  lacking  is  the  ability  for  companies  to  assess  their  key  risks  on  an integrated  basis  and  in  a  quantitative  manner.  Enterprise  risk  management  is  a significant  advancement in the field  of risk  management and provides a process for companies to identify, measure, manage and disclose all key risks. In this course the student will learn keys to successful risk identification and develop risk categorization and definition tools. The student will understand the types of risks faced by an entity and be able to identify and analyze those risks in an integrated manner as a portfolio.

The  course  seeks  to  provide  a  thorough  grounding  in  the  identification  and assessment of a wide range of risks that an entity might be exposed to in order to facilitate accurate and timely decision making in terms of the actions necessary to counter (or exploit) the risks.

## SBRM6010 RISK MANAGEMENT IN THE BUSINESS ENTERPRISE

(3 Credits) (Semester 1)

## Prerequisite

None

## Course Description

The  management  of  risks  in  business  enterprises  represents  one  of  the  greatest challenges facing business leaders in the world. The awareness of risks, identification of risks and the tools and methodologies of measurement and management of risks facing  the  enterprise  are  either  non-existent  or  inconsistently  applied  in  individual enterprises and across business sectors. Each risk type is usually handled in isolation: only the financial risks have commonly received robust quantification.

Operational  risk  has  received  attention  primarily  by  companies  in  particular industries  where  operational  failures  are  a  common  hazard.  The  specialized knowledge  and  techniques  developed  for  these  sectors  are  incorporated  into ERM and can be critically  applied  across  a  broader  spectrum  of  industries  to mitigate operational risks that are critical impediments to business performance and creation of shareholder value.

ERM also enables enterprises to determine the overall risk appetite of the firm and incorporate this in the enterprises' policies and procedures, and manage risk exposures  within  the  risk  appetite.  By  providing  a  superior  framework  for fundamental risk-return decision-making at the highest levels, ERM represents a seminal advancement in business management.

## Learning Outcomes

On completing this course, students should be able to:

- 1. Define ERM and describe the ERM process, the fundamental benefits of ERM, the value-based ERM framework and how it addresses shortcomings of traditional ERM frameworks
- 2. Identify  and  measure  the  key  risks  facing  an  enterprise  by  analyzing cases.
- 3. Describe  the  regulatory  framework  governing  the  conduct  of  business that impacts ERM across a variety of industries.
- 4. Explain  the  qualitative  and  quantitative  issues  underlying  the  study  of risk management.
- 5. Create  key  dashboard  of  risk  indicators  and  reporting  structures  for enterprise risk management.
- 6. Apply ERM  strategies that will increase the velocity with which enterprise risks are recognized, reported and addressed and integrated with policy formulation.
- 7. Define  and  categorize  risks  and  conduct  effective  qualitative  risk assessments  and  quantify  various  types  of  risk  (e.g.  financial,  market, credit,  operational  and  strategic  risks).  Describe  the  quantification  of individual risk scenarios and aggregate enterprise risk exposure.
- 8. Integrate the ERM framework with the Strategic Planning and Strategic Management frameworks of the enterprise in a variety of industries
- 9. Analyze a firm's risk appetite and identify key measures to manage risk exposures within risk appetite
- 10. Implement  proper  risk  messaging,  including  integration  of  ERM  into incentive compensation and risk disclosures.

## SBRM6040 ECONOMICS OF ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT

(3 Credits) (Semester 1)

## Prerequisite

None

## Course Description

The  Economics  of  Enterprise  Risk  Management  course  provides  a  broader economic framework and context, whereby risks can be identified and interpreted  using  economic  theory  and  thought  applicable  to  its  interpretation. For  example,  in  a  global  marketplace,  the  enterprise  must  be  increasingly conscious  about  how  and  when  changes  in  demand  and  supply  of  commodities and financial flows in world markets will transmit to their own arena and trigger off a cascade of events that puts the enterprise in jeopardy, if no risk mitigation action is taken. Conversely, opportunities emerging in local and foreign markets may  be  missed  and  not  included  in  the  enterprise's  risk management  and strategic plans.

This  course  equips  the  student  with  the  requisite  tools  of  economic  analysis  to effectively  recognize,  evaluate,  measure  and  manage  an  array  of  risks  within  a comprehensive economic and  risk management  framework.  The  Economics  of Enterprise  Risk  management  course  will  be  pivotal  in  informing  other  coursework

The ERM in the Global Business Environment course also draws upon some of the concepts developed in the Economics of Enterprise Risk Management course that provides  a  broad  economic  framework  and  context,  whereby  risks  can  be identified  and  interpreted  using  economic  theory  and  thought  applicable  to  its interpretation.  As  further  development  and  integration  of  this  framework,  five key elements of global strategy practiced by enterprises are discussed.

## Learning Outcomes

On completing this course, students should be able to:

- 1. Describe  how  business  strategy  integrates  with  ERM  and  view  the underlying  risks  identified  within  a  global  perspective  and  global framework.
- 2. Demonstrate an understanding of the strategic implications of business decisions relative to global markets and integrate this knowledge within the framework of enterprise risk management.

## Course Description

The reported statistics on information technology (IT) projects are depressing for IT specialists: by most accounts at least one in four projects ends in failure. Entire books are now devoted to IT project failure. The Standish Group reported the results of a study of over 8,000 software development projects, revealing that only  16%  were  completed  on  time  and  on  budget.  Most  of  the  remaining projects,  if  they  were  completed  at  all,  came  in  over-budget  and  behind schedule, with fewer functions and features than originally specified. These outof-control projects, in many cases, are in need of redirection. In this course, we shall examine a range of IT projects, the challenges they encounter and how to recognize the warning signs associated with failing projects and to avert or avoid IT  project  failures.
