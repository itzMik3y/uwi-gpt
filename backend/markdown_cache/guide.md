## FACULTY OF HUMANITIES &amp; EDUCATION

The  Faculty  of  Humanities  and  Education,  as  the  name  suggests,  is an amalgam under the administrative and academic oversight of one principal  accounting  officer,  the  Dean  of  the  Faculty.  The  following Departments  and  Institutes  constitute  the  Humanities  within  this amalgam: History  and  Archaeology;  Literatures  in  English;  Language, Linguistics and Philosophy; Modern Languages and Literatures; Library  and  Information  Studies;  Caribbean  Institute  of  Media  and Communication (CARIMAC); and the Institute of Caribbean Studies (ICS).

The second major component of this amalgam, the School of Education, consists  of  the  Department  of  Educational  Studies  (DES),  and  the Institute of Education (IOE).

The  Faculty,  through  the  various  structures  within  the  School  of Education  and  the  Humanities,  is  adequately  resourced  and  well positioned  to  provide  quality  education  at  the  higher  degree  level with a view to contributing to the socioeconomic advancement of the Caribbean region. The Faculty, in addition to the conventional face-toface mode of instructional delivery, also utilizes the mixed mode - that is, face-to-face and online. This is in keeping with our determination to enrich and enhance the learning experiences of those enrolled in our programmes.

## SCIENCE &amp; TECHNOLOGY

The research (MPhil and PhD) and taught master's (MSc) programmes in the Faculty of Science and Technology have been crafted in response to national and regional strategic needs. For instance, the master's degree in  renewable energy management and renewable energy technology were recently introduced due to a great demand in the market for highly skilled technical personnel and other professionals with specialization in the area of sustainable energy systems.

The MSc in medical physics was designed to build local capacity for sustainable education, training and research in medical physics, and to provide education and clinical training for careers in areas of diagnostic imaging,  nuclear  medicine,  radiation  therapy,  and  health  physics. Additionally,  the  MSc  programmes  in  plant  production  &amp;  protection and in  agricultural  entrepreneurship  will  help  to  propel  the  growth, expansion and improved productivity of the agricultural sector.

## INSTITUTE FOR GENDER AND DEVELOPMENT STUDIES

Established in 1993, the Institute of Gender and Development Studies is  an  autonomous  interdisciplinary  entity,  which  aims,  through  its programme of teaching, research and outreach, to question historically accepted theories and explanations about society and human behaviour, as well as to critically examine the origins of power differences between and among men and women and the range of factors which account for these differences.

Located  on  all  three  campuses  of  the  University,  the  impact  of  the work of the Institute is wide-ranging and far-reaching as it enjoys long established relationships and collaborations with local, regional and international development agencies, including CARICOM, the Caribbean Development Bank, the United Nations, the Commonwealth Secretariat, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) and UK Department for International Development (DFID).

## FACULTY OF LAW

The primary objective of the Faculty of Law is to provide an academic qualification which is a compulsory prerequisite to professional legal training  for  lawyers  in  the  Commonwealth  Caribbean.  However,  the traditional  basic  legal  skills  of  concise  and  pertinent  oral  argument, systematic and relevant presentation of essential issues, clarity and precision of written options and detached and balanced judgment are also useful and reliable skills for other professions such as the Civil and Police Service, Accountancy, Banking and Commerce.

The  Faculty  of  Law  offers  Three  Graduate  Programmes  -  The  LLM Corporate &amp; Commercial Law, The LLM Public Law and the LLM Legislative Drafting. In addition to the LLM, the Faculty also offers an MPhil/PhD Programme. The MPhil/PhD Programme is comprised of coursework, seminar presentations and the submission of theses.

## DOCTORAL PROGRAMMES

Research Degrees involve independent study, assisted by a Supervisor, and the production of a thesis. The essential difference between the Master and Doctoral levels, apart from the length of the registration period, lies in the quality of a successful PhD thesis. This must be judged to be the result of original research, to be an addition to knowledge and to be worthy of publication either in full or in an abridged form. The award of a PhD degree also requires that a candidate defend their thesis at a public oral examination.

Research degrees now contain a taught element. The intention of these courses is to provide students with research techniques and skills that will not only help them to complete their current research topic, but strengthen their practical application skills for life after university.

We encourage students to contact the relevant department to discuss and fine-tune their initial research proposal.
