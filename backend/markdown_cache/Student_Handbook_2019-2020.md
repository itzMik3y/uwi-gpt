## MESSAGE FROM THE VICE-CHANCELLOR

<!-- image -->

I am delighted to welcome you all to The University of the West Indies family!  You  are  entering  the  academy  at  an  exciting  time  in  our evolution.    The  UWI  family  now  includes  the  Five  Islands  campus  in Antigua and  Barbuda  where,  from  September  2019,  we  will  be providing  expanded  services  to  the  countries  of  the  OECS.  The  Five Islands campus joins the four existing campuses - the Cave Hill Campus located  in  Barbados,  the  Mona  Campus  in  Jamaica,  the  St.  Augustine Campus in Trinidad and Tobago and the Open campus which provides face-to-face and on-line delivery of courses and continuing professional

education  in  almost  50  sites  across  the  seventeen  countries  served  by  The  UWI.  Your  new, extended family consists of almost 50,000 students and 5,000 staff and includes 220,000 alumni represented  at  the  highest  levels  of  government,  corporate  and  professional  life  across  the Caribbean and worldwide.

You are also joining our community at a time when our global reputation is at an all-time high. The Times Higher Education, the world's foremost university ranking system has ranked The UWI among the top 5% of universities in the world for 2019. Keen attentiveness to achieving the  three  key  pillars  of  the  current  2017-2022  Strategic  Plan: Alignment of  industry  and academia for wealth creation and distribution; expansion of Access to tertiary education and Alertness to global opportunities has provided the impetus for this achievement.  We continue to  strive  for  ever  higher  levels  of  recognition  as  reputation  is  a  key  factor  in  assuring  our continued success in these rankings.

A key element in the rankings was our international outreach. We have increased our global reach  to  provide  opportunities  for  collaboration  and  to  facilitate  movement  of  students  and faculty. Through programmes such as the Erasmus Mundus and CARPIMS mobility schemes, the UWI-China Institute for Information Technology, cooperation agreements with Sophia University in Japan, the State University of New York, joint degree programmes, partnerships in Latin  America,  specifically  in  Colombia,  and  with  new  Institutes  established  in  collaboration with  the  University  of  Johannesburg  in  South  Africa,  the  University  of  Lagos  in  Nigeria,  and Brock University in Canada, The UWI is more globally connected that it has ever been.  I urge you to learn about these institutes and to take advantage of all the opportunities available to you for academic work and for travel across the world to meet and engage with students from other countries and cultures.

You  will  be  part  of  achieving  the  vision  we  have  articulated  for  the  next  5  years:  To  be  an excellent global university rooted in the Caribbean.  We shall be calling upon you and the entire student body, to play a role in maintaining our relevance thorough sustained high performance in academics, sports, innovation and service to our community.

The  friendship  and  networks  you  build  over  the  next  few  years  will  extend  beyond  your University life and some will last a lifetime. Take every opportunity presented you to travel to another  campus  or  another  of  the  countries  served  by  The  UWI  and  beyond  our  regional borders.  We are working towards ensuring that all students benefit from teaching by faculty members from another campus in order to deepen your learning experience as members of a regional university. We have begun to deliver the Foundation Courses online thereby creating a culture  of cross  campus  teaching.      Students  will  be  brought  together  across  physical boundaries, taught by a single lecturer and this we hope, will help to give each of you a truly regional university experience.  We hope that your relationship with us will extend beyond your graduation and that you will continue to be engaged as alumni.

Each  year,  our  new  students  inspire  enthusiasm  and  hope.  Your  University  is  committed  to ensuring  that  we  deliver  programmes  of  high  quality  and  relevance  to  national  and  regional development.  Your enthusiasm and engagement help us to stay the course.  Our contributing

Governments  continue  to  be  supportive.  However,  we  are  mindful  of  the  challenges  they themselves  face  in  meeting  their  many  obligations  and  The  UWI  has  been  making  efforts  to diversify the funding base to complement existing funding sources and to streamline operations to make them more efficient and cost effective.  Your responsibility will be to ensure that the resources  expended  in  your  training  are  maximised  as  much  as  possible.  Whether  you  are funded by your Governments, your families or yourselves, it is an investment in your future, in our collective future.

My best wishes to each of you for a fulfilling and rewarding experience at the UWI!

Blessings!

Hilary Beckles Vice-Chancellor

## MESSAGE FROM PRO VICE-CHANCELLOR AND PRINCIPAL, OPEN CAMPUS

It  gives  me  great  pleasure  to  welcome  and  greet  our  new  and returning  students  to  The  University  of  the  West  Indies  (The UWI)  Open  Campus  and  to  thank  you  for  making  the  Open Campus  your  choice  for  your  future.      To  our  new  students congratulations  on  securing  a  place  and  joining  our  proud  UWI family,  the  only  Caribbean  University  in  the  top  5%  of    all Universities in the world ranked by the Times Higher Education ranking.   To our returning students, thanks for continuing your journey with us.

Facilitation of your success in your studies as you make the most of the opportunities we offer is a  top  priority  of  the  Campus.    Our  motto  of  'Opening  Doors  to  Life  Changing  Learning'  is testimony to the Campus' adoption of new pathways to learning.  One such pathway is our Prior Learning Assessment (PLA) programme,  whereby  successful assessment of your work experience, volunteer work, attendance at training sessions or the completion of other courses, can  assist  in  earning  academic  credit  or  advanced  placement  in  a  number  of  undergraduate programmes.  Our Continuing and Professional Education (CPE) programme is an area that is rapidly  expanding  in  response  to  the  needs  of  individuals,  governments  and  private  entities whose objective is to keep abreast of rapid changes occurring in the professional environment.

In  response  to  your  varied  educational  needs,  the  Campus  offers  a  diversity  of  courses, programmes, associate degrees and degree programmes from the bachelor's to doctoral levels. These  learning  opportunities  are  offered  via  flexible  delivery  modalities  -  online  platforms, distance, blended and face-to-face delivery.  Ably supporting your choice of study is the Open Campus Libraries and Information Services (OCLIS).  The OCLIS enhances the learning, teaching and research activities of the Campus and provides a range of online and onsite resources and services  to  students.    Open  Campus  therefore  makes  it  easy  for  students  with  busy  lives  to pursue studies while being employed and taking care of families.  We are ever guided by our UWI Mission, Vision and Core Values which are:

Our Vision :

To be an excellent global university rooted in the Caribbean.

Our Mission :

To advance learning, create knowledge and foster innovation for the positive transformation of the Caribbean and the wider world.

Our Core Values:

Integrity, Excellence, Gender Justice, Diversity and Student Centredness.

We are extremely proud of our growth and resilience through many storms.    The Barbados Accreditation Council recently re-accredited the Open Campus for seven years, the maximum period  achievable.    The  Report  stated, inter  alia,  ' . . . the  Open  Campus  is  poised  to  take advantage of the opportunities presented by Global Online Strategy, its ambassadorial role in the non-physical campus countries and the growth of continuing professional education.'   This achievement  indicates  that  through  the  commitment  and  dedication  of  all  levels  of  staff  in serving  the  people  of  the  region  and  beyond,  the  Campus  distinctly  met  the  accreditation criteria and its standards.

Students,  in  addition  to  your  studies,  I  urge  you  to  get  involved  and  participate  in  the  many activities especially organized by your Site and Guild of Students.  Sporting, debating, cultural and outreach are some of the activities available and await your involvement.  You may also create lasting friendships and networks with fellow students located in the Region and beyond. In  addition,  at  our  45  Sites  throughout  the  Region  group  meetings,  study  groups  and  other group  interactions  may  be  conducted  online,  onsite  or  both  simultaneously.      These  are  all unique opportunities offered for the best Open Campus experience possible.

We are  the  online  and  onsite  Campus  and  I  invite  you  to  join,  'like'  and  follow  me  and  my personal activities on:

## MESSAGE FROM CAMPUS REGISTRAR, OPEN CAMPUS

<!-- image -->

A warm welcome to our students - new and returning - to a year of challenge,  opportunity  and,  we  affirm  ultimately,  achievement  at The  UWI  Open  Campus.    As  we  as  a  University  makes  progress towards the realisation of the transformational journey articulated in The UWI Strategic Plan 2017-2022, the Open Campus continues to align its intentions, goals and actions to the 'Triple A'  strategic goals of increasing ACCESS, being AGILE to global possibilities and being  in ALIGNMENT  with  industry  and  community  needs  to catalyse the revitalisation of Caribbean development.

The  happy  coincidence  last year of the celebrations surrounding  the  University's 70 th Anniversary and the Open Campus's 10 th  year of existence created excitement and hope for the future,  and  this  has  continued  unabated  as  the  University  and  the  Open  Campus  continue  to celebrate new achievements and attract significant recognition of its efforts to deliver quality tertiary education to the region and beyond.

In  2019,  for  the  first  time  in  its  history,  The  UWI  made  it  into  the  most  prestigious  ranking system in  the  world,  the  Times  Higher  Education  (THE)  World  University  Rankings  and  was ranked among the top 5% of Universities globally.  In March 2019, The UWI, Open Campus was awarded  reaccreditation  by  the  Barbados  Accreditation  Council  (BAC)  for  the  maximum accreditation  period  of  7  years  (2019-2026).    As  accreditation  does  not  cross  national boundaries, the Campus was granted mutual recognition by all contributing countries by either the external quality assurance agency or relevant ministry, where no agency exists, including from the Accreditation Council of Trinidad and Tobago and the University Council of Jamaica. As  Open  Campus  Quality  Assurance  Officer,  Dr  Pamela  Dottin,  attests  'the  achievement  of institutional  accreditation  by  an  external  quality  assurance  agency  signals  that  an  institution has  been  assessed  as  having  the  appropriate  systems  and  processes  in  place  to  develop  and deliver programmes and services of high quality'.

Significant  achievements  indeed!  We,  however,  accept  these  accolades,  not  to  encourage complacency, but as a challenge to not only maintain, but strengthen our quality standards for teaching, learning and research. Above all, we strive for the delivery of caring, excellent service to our students and other stakeholders.

The Registry has accepted this challenge and continues to upgrade its processes and systems to deliver a more personalised student support experience from prospective student to graduate. This academic year will see the roll out of our new Constituent Relationship Management (CRM) system as well as more opportunities for self-service. I encourage our new students to sign up for our First Year Experience programme to help you to settle into your academic and social life in our Open Campus community.

And, yes, there can be a social life! For while many of you will be valiantly juggling the many demands of family and work, there are still opportunities to have fun as part of a vibrant and special community of fellow learners. Every member of the Open Campus student family has opportunities for leadership through the Guild of Students, participation in sports through the Student  Games  and,  for  postgraduate  students,  engagement  with  the  postgraduate  debating competition.

And, as this new academic year dawns, we welcome the students and staff of the newest star in The UWI firmament, the Five Islands Campus in Antigua and Barbuda.

I wish for you all a fulfilling and enjoyable year!

Karen Ford-Warner Campus Registrar

## PART I: THE UNIVERSITY OF THE WEST INDIES

## Background

The  University  of  the  West  Indies  has  the  unusual  distinction  of  being  the  sole  regional institution  of  higher  learning  serving  seventeen  Caribbean  countries:  Anguilla,  Antigua  and Barbuda,  the  Bahamas,  Barbados,  Belize,  Bermuda,  the  British  Virgin  Islands,  the  Cayman Islands, Dominica, Grenada, Jamaica, Montserrat, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago and the Turks and Caicos Islands.  In addition, Guyana is a full participant in the Faculty of Law.

The  University  began  at  Mona,  Jamaica  in  1948  as  a  College  of  the  University  of  London.  It achieved full university status in 1962. The Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture in Trinidad was  converted  into  the  St.  Augustine  Campus  in  1961  and  in  1963  a  third  campus  was established at Cave Hill in Barbados. There is also a Centre for Hotel and Tourism Management in the Bahamas.

In  2007,  the  University  Council  approved  the  establishment  of  the  fourth  campus,  the  Open Campus, to  enable  the  University  to  expand  the  scope,  enhance  the  appeal  and  improve  the efficiency  of  its  service  to  the  individuals,  communities  and  countries  which  it  serves  across  the region,  the  diaspora  and  beyond .    The  Open  Campus  builds on  the  work  and  resources of  the School  of  Continuing  Studies,  the  Tertiary  Level  Institutions  Unit  and  the  UWI  Distance Education  Centre  to  increase  opportunities  for  access  to  tertiary  education  and  provide  an expanded  range  of  programme  offers  and  more  coherent  services  to  meet  the  needs  of  the communities we serve.  The academic year 2019/2020 will see the birth of a fifth campus, the Five Islands campus located in Antigua and Barbuda.

Through  its  several  faculties  and  different  campuses,  The  UWI  offers  degree  programmes  in Agriculture, Humanities, Education, Engineering, Law, Medical Sciences, Natural Sciences, and Social Sciences.  The UWI maintains its presence and operations throughout the region through the Open Campus.  The Open Campus has a physical Site in each contributing country (except Bermuda) and functions as a network of real and virtual nodes to deliver education and training using  a  variety  of  instructional  methods  including  distance  education,  online  and  blended learning tools and face-to-face learning.  The Country Sites allow for the blending of online and face-to-face learning experiences and promote the enrichment of the social aspects of learning in a collegial environment.

As a regional institution, The UWI offers the rich and vibrant atmosphere that results from the interaction  of  students  connected,  yet  varied,  in  cultural  and  social  backgrounds.    A  strong emphasis  on  Caribbean  issues  in  both  teaching  and  research  makes  the  university  an  ideal learning ground for both regional and international students.

## The Coat of Arms of The University of the West Indies

<!-- image -->

!

The Coat of Arms of The University of the West Indies consists of a shield and a crest.

Forming the  main  background of  the  shield  is  the  sea  represented  by  white  and  blue  (three each) wavy lines on which is the open book; the upper part of the shield, the chief, is red with a Lion to show the connection with the Crown, but the Lion is covered with black spots.  This is the Lion borne by H.R.H. Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone, appointed by the King (George VI) to be the first Chancellor, so that this appointment is recorded forever in the Coat of Arms of the University.

The crest is the brown Pelican, which fishes in its prehistoric fashion along the coasts of all the Caribbean Lands; the  pelican is  a  symbol  of  care  for  the  young  because  of  the  medieval,  but untrue, belief that it punctures its breast to feed its young on its blood.  It is also used as a crest by both Corpus Christi Colleges of Oxford and Cambridge.

The motto is: Oriens ex Occidente Lux: A Light Rising from the West

## THE UWI OPEN CAMPUS

## Open Campus Roots

The UWI Open Campus and the support it provides to the region can trace its roots back to the birth of the University of the West Indies.  In 1948 the Extra-Mural Department of the university was established on the advice of the Irvine Committee of the Asquith Commission, whose report led to the establishment of the University College of the West Indies, as it was then known.  The Asquith Report strongly recommended that the new Commonwealth universities should take a leading part in the development of adult education in the territories in which they were located. Therefore,  from  the  very  start,  the  University  recognised  that  in  addition  to  teaching  and research, the institution had a responsibility to reach out directly into the community.

The Extra-Mural Department, which eventually evolved into the School of Continuing Studies, offered  locally driven  programmes  of  public  education,  adult  education  and  continuing education in contributing countries designed to enhance academic, professional and vocational skills, and to provide opportunities to pursue tertiary level studies.

The Tertiary Level Institutions Unit (TLIU) also worked to enhance access to tertiary education in the region by linking the University's resources, programmes  and  services to the development  of  tertiary  education  institutions.    The  TLIU  supported  the  development  of articulation  and  franchising  arrangements  with  tertiary  institutions  across  the  region  and engaged  in  special  projects  promoting  collaboration  and  cooperation  within  the  Caribbean tertiary education system.

In  1983,  The UWI began offering distance education courses using an audio-teleconferencing system  that  was  known  as  the  UWI  Distance  Teaching  Experiment  -  later  Enterprise  UWIDITE.  UWIDITE  course  delivery  was  primarily  via  teleconferencing  and  correspondence packages.  The name UWIDITE soon became associated with the audio-teleconferencing system through which The UWI made education and training more accessible, especially to people in the  Eastern  Caribbean.    Working  with  Faculties  across  the  University,  UWIDITE  produced learning packages and delivered courses through the teleconferencing system, which enabled students across the region to complete Part 1 of some degree programmes without attending a residential campus.

On August 1, 1996, the amalgamation of the Distance Education Unit, Challenge Examinations, and  UWIDITE  was  completed  with  the  establishment  of  the  Distance  Education  Centre (UWIDEC).  UWIDEC  undertook  to  create  a  blended  learning  environment  that  embraced asynchronous online delivery methods in combination with online tutors,  paper-based study material  and  teleconferences  for  planning,  guidance  and  examination  preparations.    This became known as the UWI Blended Learning Model.

The  range  of  courses  offered  was  expanded  to  facilitate  students  completing  full  degree programmes through distance technologies.  Thereafter, the drive was to improve the quality of The UWI distance education offerings and move towards being a full dual-mode institution in which  distance  education  programmes  are  offered  alongside  the  traditional  face-to-face programmes.

The latest  chapter in  expanding  the  reach  of  The  UWI  in  the  communities  we  serve  was  the creation  of  the  Open  Campus  in  July  2008.    The  Open  Campus  was  created  to  improve  the service  to  the  UWI-12  countries  and  the  underserved  communities  in  residential  campus countries  that  do  not  have  access  to  the  campus-based  programmes  and  to  provide  flexible learning options.

## The Open Campus Guiding Principles

The Open Campus of The University of the West Indies is based on the idea that the high-quality university  education,  research  and  services  available  at  our  institution  should  be  open  and available to all people who wish to reach their full potential inside and outside of the Caribbean region.    The  Open  Campus  will  adopt  quality  teaching  and  learning  experiences,  innovative pedagogic  design,  relevant  research  and  community  partnerships  to  deliver  face-to-face, blended and online learning to all of its communities.

## The Organisational Structure of the Open Campus

The  Open  Campus  is  headed  by  a  Pro  Vice-Chancellor  and  Principal  who  oversees  the operations  of  the  campus.    The  campus  is  comprised  of  10  functional  units,  which  have responsibility  for  the  management  of  the  affairs  of  the  campus  and  the  delivery  of  its programmes and services.  The UWI Open Campus has administrative offices at Cave Hill, Mona and St. Augustine Campuses and Country Sites throughout the region (a list of Sites and contact information is provided at Appendix B or can be found at www.open.uwi.edu/locations).  Site Heads  in  each  country  manage  the  Open  Campus'  affairs  for  their  country.    In  addition,  Site Coordinators manage the distance learning and face-to-face operations at delivery sites.

disadvantaged within the Caribbean to attain their full potential through providing formal and non-formal education, research and technical assistance using a person-centred approach.

Units currently incorporated in the Consortium are:

## The Caribbean Child Development Centre (CCDC)

Originally established as the Regional Preschool Child Development Centre in 1972, the Centre was renamed the Caribbean Child Development Centre in 1985 to more accurately reflect its evolving role in child development.

The Centre's mission is to provide support for the holistic development of Caribbean children, through  collaborative  research  to  inform  policy  and  programme  development,  information management and dissemination, teaching and training, public service and promotion of the best possible outcomes for children.

## The Hugh Shearer Labour Studies Institute (HSLSI)

A gift from the United States Government to the trade unions and people of Jamaica in 1973, the HSLSI was established to train upper level trade union personnel from Jamaica and the Eastern Caribbean for free and democratic trade union leadership.

The HLSTUEI provides expert training, certificate programmes, courses, lectures and classes in trade union and labour education, promotes research on industrial relations in the Caribbean region,  fosters  the  development  of  healthy  industrial  relations  in  the  region  and  organises international, regional and local conferences on trends in labour education.

## The Social Work Training and Research Centre (SWTRC)

Established  in  1962,  the  SWTRC  was  expressly  designed  to  train  paraprofessional  social workers in the governmental and non-governmental sectors in the region.

The  SWTRC  educates  students  who  can  apply  the  knowledge  of  a  generalist  social  work perspective  to  practice  interventions  with  individuals,  families,  groups,  organisations  and communities  in  the  Caribbean  region,  and  prepares  social  work  practitioners  who  can  work effectively with clients of various sizes and types in the region.

## The Women and Development Unit (WAND)

Established  in  1978,  WAND  provides  a  community  outreach  service  for  The  UWI  to  directly influence women's education and women's leadership.  The Unit has contributed greatly to the articulation of the vital role of women, community and NGO development within the Caribbean.

WAND identifies opportunities for  incorporating women's  issues  and  activities  from  research into viable and relevant teaching programmes or modules and promotes and supports women's development through community action, training, research, documentation and dissemination of educational material. The Unit also develops the social consciousness of women and provides them  with  the  tools  of  empowerment,  evaluates  the  way  development  impacts  on  women  in varying situations, and evaluates and promotes the way women work for a sustainable future in their own communities.

## PART III: LIFELONG LEARNING &amp; DISTANCE EDUCATION

<!-- image -->

## LIFELONG LEARNING

Lifelong Learning is a commitment to continuously acquire new knowledge and skills. The UWI Open  Campus  provides  opportunities  for  the  lifelong  learner  in  the  Caribbean.  We  are committed to fostering the interests of adult students and the lifelong learning community by working closely with our regional partners.

The UWI has a long tradition of outreach programmes that provide valuable opportunities for mature students to take courses on a part-time basis.  Both credit and non-credit courses are provided in a wide range of areas.  We offer basic education, the upgrading of professional and paraprofessional skills, as well as UWI Certificates, Diplomas and Degrees.

By enrolling in our programmes, large numbers of our people across the Caribbean region have benefited from the experience of study at an institution of higher learning and have been able to advance to tertiary education both within and outside of The UWI system. This work is a vital contribution to lifelong learning, and we attach high priority to its continuation.

## Studying at the Open Campus

Many  successful  people  have  chosen  to  study  at  the  Open  Campus  as  it  provides  attractive options  for  lifelong  learning  and  career  development  in  a  variety  of  formats  and  modes  of delivery.   Some  of  the  reasons  that  learners  within  the  Caribbean  choose  the  Open  Campus include:

- 1. Access: The  Open  Campus  provides  opportunities  for  students  to  gain  access  to  higher education.  The design of our programmes with entry at several levels allows more student access to The UWI through a number of different academic options.

- 2. Study at your own pace: The mixed mode teaching delivery method of the Open Campus allows students to organise their time to better fit in with their personal and employment commitments.  Students can achieve their academic goals on a flexible schedule.
- 3. Cost-effectiveness: It is becoming increasingly difficult for students to undertake full-time residential  study,  particularly  for  those  in  rural  districts  or  in  the  countries  of  the Caribbean without physical UWI campuses.  The Open Campus offers programmes at less cost than full-time residential study programmes.
- 4. In-country education and training: One of our advantages is the very nature of the Open Campus structure. We have several locations in contributing countries of the University.   Many  of  our  programmes  offer  students  the  opportunity  to  study  while remaining  in  full-time  employment.   In  addition,  the  new  skills  and  knowledge  learned allow first-hand implementation in the work situation.
- 5. Professional  Development: The  Open  Campus  offers  opportunities  for  persons  to  keep abreast of new ideas and concepts in their preferred fields of work or in disciplines. Our students are provided with a quality educational experience that promotes their academic and professional success.

## Distance Education

Distance education is  a  process  in  which  the  learners  and  their  instructors  are  separated  by time  and/or  distance.  Communication  and  interaction  is  facilitated  by  different  educational technologies and instructional strategies.

Communication  between  the  instructor  and  the  learner  is  non-contiguous  but  interactive, employing various media - print, audio, video - and various delivery methods - audio, video and computer and web conferencing, as well as email, rather than (but sometimes including) faceto-face methods.

There are two types of delivery methods:

- 1. Asynchronous delivery, which requires interaction and communication between participants that happen at different times; and
- 2. Synchronous  delivery  that  requires  interaction  and  communication  in  real  time,  with learner and facilitator, in different geographical locations.

## How to Succeed in Studying at a Distance

As students you are entering a learning environment that may be foreign to many of you.  It is unlike any traditional classroom experience you have ever had. To succeed, first and foremost you must be motivated and able to manage your own learning experiences. Learning is your responsibility. The UWI Open Campus strives to create the best possible learning environment for  you  and  your  peers, and therefore will provide the resources and facilitators you need to achieve your academic goals.

You  may,  at  times,  experience  a  feeling  of  isolation  and  loneliness.   This  does  not  need  to happen.  You must learn to virtually network with your peers and supporting members of staff as  well  as  make  the most of  the  online  and communications tools that the Open Campus has provided.   You  should  regularly  attend  any  teleconferences,  web  conferencing  or  face-to-face meetings  organized  by  your  Course  Coordinator,  e-Tutor,  and  other  members  of  staff  in  the Academic Programming and Delivery Division (APAD). Below are some tips to consider or skills you need to master.

- 1. Time  Management -  One  of  the  biggest  problems  when  studying  at  a  distance  is  the inability to manage your time.  The average online course requires ten to twelve hours of online and offline activities each week.  That means you need to create a study schedule

and stick to it.  You need to dedicate time to complete your assignments and exercises on time.

- 2. Personal  Organisation -  You  need  to  ensure  you  have  a  process  for  managing  the resources, readings and discussions you will be required to complete as you move through your  programme.   You  need  to  create  a  system  for  capturing  websites  and  other  online resources that may be needed in the courses in your academic programme.
- 3. Research Skills - Most courses require learners to investigate or produce unique products or papers that require independent research.  You must learn how to use the online library and how to critically analyse and summarize papers, journal articles and books.
- 4. Family Obligations - Many of you will have families.  As you study, you must ensure that your  family  knows  when  you  are  available  and  when  you  need  to  have  quiet  time  to study.  One strategy is to involve them in creating a study schedule and posting it where everyone can see it.
- 5. Separate Study Area -  You  need to ensure that you have a separate study area that is quiet and free from distractions.   It  should ideally be an area where you can leave your study material and readings out as you move through the course .
- 6. Communications Skills - Because much of the interaction and communication in distance education is through the written word, you must be able to effectively communicate in the English language.
- 7. Technical  Skills -  If  you  are  not  computer  literate,  you  must  become  so  if  you  are  to succeed  in  a  distance-learning  environment.   You  will  be  required  to  create  Word documents; Excel spread sheets, PowerPoint slides and work with different web communication and research tools.

## Working With Your Online Department

Most  online  courses  have  both  a  Course  Coordinator  and  a  number  of  e-Tutors.     Course Coordinators  are  the  course  managers,  lead  instructors  and  academic  facilitators  for  the courses.  They are responsible for customizing the course and managing the e-Tutors assigned to the courses.

Courses are divided into separate groups of up to 34 learners.  Each group will be assigned an eTutor to facilitate the interactions in the group, to mark assignments and to provide feedback to learners.  The specific duties in the course require the e-Tutor to:

- 1. Guide the learning experience of all students and act as a resource for learners as they move through the course;
- 2. Make available, where required, additional material to enhance the learning experience of the students;
- 3. Respond  to  all  student  queries  in  the  Tutor-Student  Exchange  forum  and,  where necessary,  access  information  from  the  appropriate  source  in  order  to  address  the matter raised;
- 4. Provide guidance on all learning activities;
- 5. Regularly communicate with individual students via email to counsel, guide, advise and motivate them; and
- 6. Regularly contribute to all discussions and provide appropriate feedback to learners.

You should view your e-Tutor and Course Coordinator as persons who are there to facilitate your learning and assist you to succeed.  Do not be afraid to ask them questions.  If you realize you  want  to  learn  more  about  a  specific  concept  or  topic  feel  free  to  ask  your  facilitator  for guidance to source additional resources. If you are struggling with a concept or idea, then share your concerns with your e-Tutor. He or she is there to help you master these concepts.  If you think  others  in  the  course  would  have  similar  questions,  then  post  your  query  in  the appropriate discussion area.

## Format of Open Campus Courses for Regional Programmes

The Open Campus has a mix of blended and fully online courses. There are currently two types because of the evolution from self-study, teleconference supported courses to blended learning courses, to fully online courses.  Let us explore each format:

Fully  Online  Courses -  Fully  online  courses  are  delivered  via  the  Open  Campus  Moodle Learning Management System, referred to as the Learning Exchange . In this modality all course instruction and assessments are offered online in the Learning Exchange. Course material and learning  software/tools  are  provided  in  the  course.  Some  courses  may  require  an  additional text. When this situation arises, you will be required to pay the full amount of the cost of that additional  textbook.  You  may  also  purchase  any  additional  material  resource  through  online bookstores.

Open Campus students registered in fully online courses come from different countries in the Caribbean. With the diversity of cultures, you have the opportunity to engage in meaningful and cross-cultural  debates,  work-based  exercises  and  case  studies  within  a  learning  environment that  promotes  a  community  of  learners  and  cooperative  and  collaborative  skills.  Courses  are interactive  in  their  design  and  require  regular  communication  and  information  sharing  with peers  and  the  course  facilitators.  These  fully  online  courses  require  learners  to  actively participate  in  all  online  discussions  and,  when  appropriate,  require  online  small  group  work interaction among peers. Courses are supported through synchronous sessions on Blackboard Collaborate (BbC) through the Learning Exchange .  In  this  environment  you  and  your  e-Tutor and Course Coordinator meet in real time that mirrors face-to-face interaction.

Blended Learning Courses -  Blended  learning  courses  are  a  mix  of  face-to-face  and  online delivery via the Learning Exchange.

The blended modality in the Open Campus is configured as follows:

- a. Online delivery, inclusive of synchronous web conferencing sessions on BbC; and faceto-face examinations;
- b. Online  delivery  as  indicated  in  'a'  above;  as  well  as  face-to-face  classes  and/or  field supervised instruction; and
- c. Study  materials,  including  online  files,  along  with  synchronous  and  asynchronous classes offered in the Learning Exchange to support the blended modality.

The blended learning courses require learners to regularly interact online in their course and to complete  assessments  online.  Interaction  online  includes  discussion  exercises  on  forums  for development  of critical thinking skills, journaling, reflective practice, use of tools for collaboration and cooperative learning and activities that promote development of leadership skills.

Face-to-Face Learning Modality - In addition to the online and the blended courses, the Open Campus facilitates the design and delivery of face-to-face university credit, as well as not-forcredit courses, workshops and seminars. Many of the courses and programmes offered by the Open  Campus  are  developed  in  response  to  particular  local  needs.  To  ensure  that  the  local professional development  and  academic needs in different countries and communities throughout the Caribbean are supported, the Open Campus will continue to deliver face-to-face learning  experiences.   Some  will  be  professional development  experiences  and  others  will  be courses  that  are  completed  for  credit  in  a  specific  programme  approved  by  The  UWI.   Site Coordinators  and  Site  Heads  organize  and  conduct  these  workshops,  seminars  and  courses, with the support of the Academic Programming and Delivery Division through its curriculum development and production teams.

## Quality of the Distance Learning Experience

The University of the West Indies is a dual mode institution that offers a variety of programme methodologies both by face-to-face  and  distance education methods.  Degrees completed  at  a distance  are  equal  in  quality  to  those  taken  in  the  face-to-face  mode  on  The  UWI  physical campuses. Like the physical campuses the UWI Open Campus, through its curriculum, prepares its students with the academic abilities, skills, and personal and professional attributes required of The UWI graduate.

## The attributes of the Distinctive UWI Graduate are:

- -A critical and creative thinker;
- -an effective communicator with good interpersonal skills;
- -IT-skilled and information literate;
- -innovative and entrepreneurial;
- -globally aware and well-grounded in his/her regional identity;
- -socially, culturally and environmentally responsible; and
- -guided by strong ethical values.

## Re-Accreditation of The UWI Open Campus

The University of the West Indies, Open Campus has institutional accreditation awarded by the Barbados Accreditation Council.  The Campus underwent its reaccreditation process in March, 2019 and was awarded the maximum accreditation period of 7 years (2019-2026).  As accreditation  does  not  cross  geographical  boundaries,  the  University  applied  for  and  was granted  mutual  recognition  in  all  contributing  countries  by  either  the  external  quality assurance agency  or relevant ministry, where  no  agency exists, including from  the Accreditation Council of Trinidad and Tobago and University Council of Jamaica.

Mutual recognition means that the agency or ministry has agreed to accept the institutional accreditation decision of another agency, in this case of the Barbados Accreditation Council, and  to  recognize  the  institution  as  one  that  meets  external  quality  standards.    Part  of  the requirements for maintenance of institutional accreditation is that the Open Campus annually submits  reports  to  the  Barbados  Accreditation  Council  and  entities  granting  it  mutual recognition showing how it has sustained and improved on the quality of its provisions over the period under review.

The achievement of institutional accreditation by an external quality assurance agency signals that an institution has been assessed as having the appropriate systems and processes in place to develop and deliver programmes and services of high quality.

## PRIOR  LEARNING  ASSESSMENT  (PLA)  FOR  ADVANCED  PLACEMENT AND MATRICULATION

The  University  of  the  West  Indies  Open  Campus  recognizes  that  learning  takes  place  in  a number of settings - formal, non-formal and informal. It is open and committed to the idea of Prior Learning Assessment.

Prior Learning Assessment, or PLA, is the term used to describe the method of assessment used to  identify,  document  and  evaluate  the  college/university  level  learning  outcomes  which individuals have achieved from formal, non-formal and informal learning.

The learning might have been obtained, for example, from attending training workshops, short courses,  seminars  or  conferences,  engaging  in  community/volunteer  work  or  on-the-job training.

PLA ensures that once learning has taken place, it can be assessed and the appropriate academic credit granted.  This credit can be used for advanced placement  or matriculation/admissions into an undergraduate programme of study at The UWI Open Campus.

PLA  holds  tremendous  potential  for  you  to  have  your  learning  from  experience  assessed. Furthermore, the PLA system provides a great opportunity to further your education.

## Degree Programmes Offered for PLA for Advanced Placement through PLPD0100

The Prior Learning and Portfolio Development/Assessment Course: PLPD0100 will help you to advance in your degree programme.  PLA for advanced placement is currently offered for up to 7 Level 1 courses in the following undergraduate degrees:

- 1. BSc Accounting
- 2. BSc Banking and Finance
- 3. BEd Early Childhood Development and Family Studies
- 4. BSc Management Studies
- 5. BSc Youth Development Work

You  will  be  guided  by  a  Course  Coordinator  to  develop  your  personal  experiential  learning portfolio for assessment by trained subject content experts.

Learners who obtain PLA credits and associated exemptions will be awarded for their relevant experiential learning and gain advanced placement in their undergraduate programme of study at the Open Campus.

## Prior Learning Assessment for Matriculation: PLPD001

The Prior Learning and Portfolio Development/Assessment Course: PLPD001 for matriculation will assist you to satisfy the relevant University minimum  entrance  requirements  for matriculation,  at  Lower  Level,  for  admission  to  degree  or  other  programmes  offered  by  the Open Campus.

You will be required, through credentials and/or relevant experiential learning, to demonstrate competence in five (5) Caribbean Examination Council (CXC) - Caribbean Secondary Education Certificate (CSEC) examinations to gain entry to The UWI Open Campus.

The subjects on which you would base your prior learning portfolio are: English, Accounting, Mathematics,  Principles  of  Business,  Information  Technology,  Social  Studies  and  Integrated Science.

In the PLPD001 course, you will be instructed, step by step, by a Course Instructor on how to demonstrate  your  learning  and  create  a  portfolio.    Your  completed  portfolio  will  then  be assessed by subject content experts and, if successful, you will receive a maximum of 15 credits toward admission  to  UWI  Open  Campus.    Successful  completion  of  the  PLPD001  Course  and your learning portfolio will allow you to continue your journey towards the fulfillment of your educational goals.

For  additional  information  on  Prior  Learning  Assessment  please  email  the  PLA  Unit  at pla@open.uwi.edu.

## Qualifying Tests and Remedial Courses

## The English Language Proficiency Test (ELPT)

All  students  who  do  not  have  the  qualifications  to  allow  them  to  register  for English  for Academic Purposes (FOUN1001) must take the English Language Proficiency Test (ELPT). For a list of qualifications exempting students from taking the ELPT, please visit http://www.open.uwi.edu/admissions

## What if You Fail the English Language Proficiency Test?

If  you fail the ELPT, you will have to take a course called Language Proficiency for Tertiary Level .  Self-instructional material is designed for this course and they can be bought from your Open Campus Site.  Enquire at your Site for information on how to obtain this material.  Once you have completed the course, you retake the ELPT.  Check at your Site to find out when and how often the test is administered.

## Remedial Mathematics

An approved qualification in Mathematics is a requirement for entry into certain BSc and ASc programmes. You are required to have the minimum of CXC-CSEC General Proficiency or the equivalent, or you will be required to pass a remedial Mathematics course in the summer prior to  admission to  the  programme  of  study.   Approved  remedial  Mathematics  courses  include

Improving  Your  Math  Skills  (IYMS)  and  MATH0900 Mathematics (for  ASc  students).   Please consult your nearest Site office with respect to the course on offer.

A pass in CXC-CSEC or GCE 'O' Level Mathematics is a prerequisite for ECON1003 Mathematics for the Social Sciences .  You are required to obtain the requisite pass in one of these Mathematics courses  or  an  approved  remedial  Mathematics  course  before  you  are  allowed  to  register  for ECON1003.

## Credit Exemptions

All students  must  note  that  there  are  two  separate  procedures  for  students  who  need exemptions processed. PROCEDURE 1: APPLICATIONS BASED ON APPROVED EXEMPTION LISTING PROVIDED AND PROCEDURE 2:  APPLICATIONS FOR THOSE WHO NEED TO HAVE THEIR  EXEMPTION  REQUESTS  ASSESSED  TO  DETERMINE  IF  THEY  ARE  ELIGIBLLE  FOR EXEMPTIONS. Please  note  that  there  are  no  deadline  dates  for  a  Procedure  1  exemption request. However, if you wish to request Procedure 2 exemptions, you must do so by the end of the  third  week  of  classes  of  Semesters  I  and II. All requests  should  be  made  to  the  Registry (Student Support and Services) using the relevant exemption application form available in your MyOC Student Services Portal under the Forms and Booklets Resources Section.  Every semester the guidelines for the exemption requests will be emailed directly to students.

An official transcript will be required for assessment by the authorised body, unless the courses for which you are seeking exemption are from programmes/courses students have completed through The UWI. For those exemption requests that have not been assessed previously by The UWI,  you  will  need  to  submit  course  outlines  and  transcripts  to  facilitate  the  analysis  for equivalence. Incomplete packages will not be processed.

The  granting  of  exemptions  (and  credits)  for  non-UWI  programmes  must  be  based  on equivalency to courses in each degree option.  If a course, already completed successfully, is the same as that  to  be  pursued  at  a  particular  level,  a  student  may  receive  exemption  from  that course.   In  keeping  with  The  UWI's  policy,  exemptions  (and  credits)  will  only  be  granted  for courses that have been successfully pursued within the last five (5) years. Credit exemptions do not count towards the GPA.

## PART VI:  EXAMINATIONS

<!-- image -->

For some courses, you may be required to do assignments, sit mid-semester tests as well as endof-semester  examinations.    Examinations  are  held  at  designated  examination  centres  (for example, an Open Campus Site) in your country.  Some courses may have an alternative to the final examination, such as a major project/action research.

Examinations are  different from assignments, quizzes or online tests that might be a part of your  coursework.    Examinations  must  be  written  in  a supervised  environment , with  an approved Examination Invigilator (Proctor/Supervisor).

## Open Campus Examinations

The UWI has five (5) campuses; in most cases, examination papers are different for each campus for logistical reasons.  Therefore, when attending an examination, you should ensure that the examination paper is the one prescribed for Open Campus students - this will be clearly stated at the top of the examination paper.

All  written  final  examinations  have  sessions  scheduled  either  for  the  morning  (9:00  a.m.), afternoon (1:00 p.m.), or evening (4:00 p.m.) and are two or three hours in duration. In some exceptional cases, examinations may be scheduled on public holidays.

Mid-semester examinations are usually held from 5:00 p.m.

## Open Campus Examinations Timetable

The Examinations Timetable for Open Campus students is scheduled differently from the one for students at any of the other campuses. Make sure that the Examinations Timetable from which you take your schedule is the Open Campus Examinations Timetable.

## Writing Examinations at Your Open Campus Site/Examination Centre

On acceptance to the Open Campus, you were assigned to a Site.  You are expected to write your examinations at this Site, with the exception of students assigned to the Virtual International Students Office (VISO).  When you register for a course, you are simultaneously registering for the  examination;  therefore,  you  are  not  required to  make  any  additional  arrangements  to  be

examined.    You  are  simply  required  to  check  with  your  Site  to  find  out  which  room  your examination will be taking place in - this information is usually provided via the Sites' notice boards.

## Writing Examinations at an Alternate Open Campus Site

If  you are unable to write examinations at the Open Campus Site at which you are registered, you must formally make a request to write them at another Open Campus Site .  To do this, you must make the request to the Senior Assistant Registrar, Assessment, Awards and Records, Open Campus, through your Site Head or Site Coordinator by completing the required form at https://goo.gl/forms/8FyoIm4vg0FKF8Sd2 at least  twenty-one  (21)  days  ahead of  your examination(s) to make sure that you can be accommodated.  There is a late application fee of US$30.00 or the equivalent in your local currency for requests made after this date and no later  than  one  week  before  the  start  of  the  examination  period.    We  cannot  accommodate requests made less than seven (7) days before your examination. Students failing to make requests in a timely manner and are subsequently absent from their examinations will be subject  to  the  usual  penalties  for  absence  and  will  be  deemed  to  have  failed  the examination.

## Writing Examinations Outside of Countries with UWI Examination Centres

If  you  wish  to  take  your  written  examinations  at  a  location  other  than  a  UWI  Examination Centre, you are required to identify a proctor at an accredited post-secondary institution such as  a  University,  Community  College  or  Technical  Institute  and  your  examination  must  be supervised by a professor, instructor or otherwise qualified person.  Alternately, you may take your examination at an Embassy or Consulate that offers proctoring services to international students. The proctoring institution MUST be able to communicate in English in order for your examinations to be facilitated.

It is the student's responsibility to identify a suitable proctor sixty 60 days in advance of the examination.    To  do  this,  you  must  complete  an EXTERNAL PROCTOR FORM found  on  the Student Portal and submit it to the Senior Assistant Registrar, Assessment, Awards and Records for evaluation and approval of the proctor.  The completed proctor form should be submitted via the link on the student portal or by post to the address indicated below:

The Senior Assistant Registrar Assessment, Awards and Records The University of the West Indies Open Campus Learning Centre Cave Hill Campus P.O. Box 1341 Bridgetown BB11000 BARBADOS

## Fees for Writing Examinations Outside of a UWI Examination Centre

The UWI does not charge an examination fee, however, students are required to cover the cost of  couriering their examination papers to the proctoring institution and the cost of returning their completed scripts to The UWI for marking.  The cost of this courier service is US$120.00 and must be paid thirty (30) days in advance of your examination .

Upon  receipt  of  your  request  to  be  proctored  externally,  and  as  soon  as  your  proctor  is approved, you will be billed for the courier cost.  You should access the payment gateway and make  the  payment at  least  thirty  (30)  days  before  your  examination .    Your  examination cannot be sent off until your payment has been made.  Under no circumstances will examination

papers be couriered less than ten (10) days before the date of the examination.  Students should therefore make their payments on time.

## Instructions to Candidates Taking a Written Examination

- 1. It is your responsibility to ascertain the dates and times of the examination(s) for which you are registered. Under  no  circumstances  should  you  rely  on  any  oral communication of the Examinations Timetable   No member of staff is authorised . to communicate timetable information to you.
- 2. You will be informed of the dates and times of written examination papers by means of the Examinations Timetable published on the Official Notice Board at your Site and on the  Web  through  the  MyOC  Student  Portal  http://my.open.uwi.edu  at  least  one  (1) month in advance, or two (2) weeks in the case of Summer or Re-sit Examinations.  Any changes  in  dates  after  publication  shall  be  brought  to  your  attention  by  means  of additional  notices  posted  at  each  Site  and  on  the  Web.    You  will  not  be  informed individually of such changes.  Under no circumstances will any such changes be made later than one (1) week prior to the commencement of the series of examinations. You should  therefore  verify  your  examinations  timetable  one  (1)  week  before  the examination period. You  should also  make sure you take the date and time of your examination from a final timetable and not a draft (drafts are subject to change).
- 3. If  you are absent from an examination owing to a mis-reading of the timetable you shall be liable to the normal penalties for absence from an examination (i.e. you will  be  awarded  a  grade  of  Failed  Absent/FA)  and  will  have  to  await  the  next officially scheduled sitting to take the examination.  Note that FA is a failing grade and negatively impacts your GPA.
- 4. You  should  be  present  at  the  examination  room  fifteen  (15)  minutes  before  the advertised start time of any examination.  You shall be admitted up to half-an-hour after the start of the examination.  You shall not be allowed extra time if you arrive late.  If you arrive  more  than  half-an-hour  late  you  may  be  admitted  to  the  examination  room; however, your written or practical work will be accepted for marking only if you can satisfy the Campus Registrar that you have valid reasons for being late.

## Steps to Take Before an Examination

- 1. Verify that you are registered for the course(s) of the examination(s) you intend to sit. You should immediately report any discrepancies in your registration to your Site Head or Site Coordinator.  In the case of international students, you should inform the VISO office.
- 2. Make sure you have the correct time and location of your examination.  In the case of students writing examinations at the Cave Hill, St. Augustine or Mona campuses, please familiarize yourself with the campus and know where your examination venue is. Do not wait until the day of the examination to familiarize yourself with the campus as this could take some time due to the size of these locations.
- 3. Arrive at your examination location at least fifteen (15) minutes prior to its scheduled start.

## Conduct in the Examination Room

- 1. Candidates are required at all times to comply with the instructions of the Chief Invigilator and/or Assistant Invigilator(s).
- 2. Candidates should have their UWI Identification Cards to present to the Invigilator.
- 3. Candidates shall write their identification numbers and not their names using permanent ink, distinctly at the top of the cover of every answer book and/or separate sheet of paper which is handed  in.      Candidates  shall  NOT  write  their  names  anywhere  on  the  answer  book  or supplementary book.
- 4.  Unless  otherwise  permitted, all examinations shall  be  written  in  permanent  ink  preferably blue or black.

- 7. Candidates are not allowed to leave the examination room during the first thirty (30) minutes or last fifteen (15) minutes of an examination except in the case of illness.
- 8. Students should not deface any examination material.    It is an offense to do so.   You should not tear any of the answer booklets or supplementary sheets.    Neither should you take any examination material with you from the examination room.

## Absence from Examinations

When you register at the beginning of the Semester for any course, you are at the same time registering to be examined for that course. If you register for a course and do not take the examination you will be recorded as Failed Absent/FA and the usual penalties of a failure will apply.

Please note that the Assessment Regulations for First Degrees, Associate Degrees, Undergraduate Diplomas and Certificates state:

Any student who, having registered for a course, fails to take the examination, shall be  deemed  to  have  failed  the  examination  unless  the  relevant  Academic  Board decides otherwise on the recommendation of the relevant Faculty Board.

## Late Withdrawal from a Course/Examination after the Deadline

A  student  may  withdraw  from  a  course  during  the  official  registration  period.    Additionally, students may apply for late de-registration after the official registration period has ended but before the end of the 6th week of teaching .  Approval for de-registration will be determined by the Academic, Programming and Delivery Division.

If  a  student  is  granted  permission  to  withdraw  from  a  course  after  the  official  registration period has ended but before the end of the 6th week of teaching, a final grade definition of LW (Late Withdrawal) shall be assigned.  An LW grade has no impact on a student's GPA.

If a student stops attending the course and does not officially withdraw, a final grade definition of FA (Failed/Absent) will be assigned and will have a negative impact on GPA.

Withdrawals are not permitted once grades have been posted for the semester.  If a student has documentable, extenuating circumstances, a petition may be submitted for review.

Withdrawing  from  course(s)  after  the  deadline  does  not  relieve  the  student  from financial liability.

## Absence from Examinations Because of Illness

You must request permission for absence from an examination because of illness; however, you must support your request with a medical report submitted  through  your  Site  Head or  Site Coordinator  to  the  Campus  Registrar  (through  the  Senior  Assistant  Registrar,  Assessment, Awards and Records, Open Campus) within seven (7) days from the date of the examination in  which your performance is affected.  The medical report should give brief details of the nature of the illness without breaching medical ethics.  Consideration for absence cannot be given if the medical certificate submitted does not state the nature of your illness.

The Assessment Regulations for First Degrees, Associate Degrees, Undergraduate Diplomas and Certificates state inter alia that:

- (a) Where the performance of a candidate in any part of any examination is likely to have been affected by factors of which the Examiners have no knowledge, or where the candidate is absent from the examination due to such factors, the candidate may report the circumstances in writing to the Campus Registrar. If the candidate decides to report such circumstances, he/she must do so within seven (7) days of that part of the examination which may have been affected ;
- (b) Where  the  factors  referred  to  in  (a)  relate  to  illness  the  Report  to  the  Campus Registrar must be accompanied by a medical report signed by a Campus Medical Officer, as proof of illness; or, in the case of the Open Campus, by any other medical practitioner approved for that purpose by the Campus Registrar.
- (c) The medical report shall be submitted within seven (7) days from the date of that  part  of  the  assessment  in  which  the  performance  of  the  candidate  is affected . A report received after this period will be considered only in exceptional circumstances;
- (d) Where  a  student  is  unable  to  submit  a  medical  report  in  person,  the  Campus Medical Officer  or  a  medical  practitioner,  as  the  case  may  be,  may  do  so  on  the student's behalf within the prescribed time;
- (e) The Campus Registrar shall pass on the information on illness or other factors as communicated in (a) - (d) above, to the Chair of the Board of Examiners to assist the Board in the performance of its duties in finalising the student's examination record by awarding an appropriate final mark, or an appropriate designation in accordance with the Grade Point Average Regulations; and
- (f) The Board of Examiners shall not take cognizance of illness or other circumstances presented as affecting a student's performance at an examination which have not been referred to them by the Campus Registrar.

The  non-refundable  administrative  fee  of BDS$130.00 or its equivalent is payable to the Bursary for the re-mark to be processed.

In the case of the re-marking of a script under Regulation 142(b) the mark of the Independent Examiner(s) shall be regarded as the final mark (whether the mark is higher or lower) .

## Review of Mid-Semester Examinations and Coursework Results

The Assessment Regulations for First Degrees, Associate Degrees, Undergraduate Diplomas and Certificates state that:

Re-marking shall apply to coursework where a single component counts for 40% or more . That component may be re-marked as provided in Regulation 142(b).

## The University of the West Indies (UWI) Grading Policy for Undergraduate Students Effective Academic Year 2014-2015

In  an  effort  to  align  the  standards  of  The  University  of  the  West  Indies  more  closely  with international norms that reflect best practice, a new Grading Policy (2014/2015 Grading Policy) was introduced from the beginning of  the  new  academic  year, 2014/2015.  The  new  Grading Regulations took effect on 1 st  August, 2014 and are only applicable to undergraduate students enrolled in programmes governed by GPA Regulations.   The new Grading Policy will therefore be in effect for all future coursework assessments and examinations.

The 2014/2015 Grading Policy implements changes in the grade bands, percentage marks, and quality  points  (points  used  in  calculating  Grade  Point  Average)  associated  with  each  letter grade.  The table below outlines the differences between the 2014/2015 Grading Policy and the previous grading policy.

## Grade Point Average System and Marking Scheme

- 1. The  class  of  degree  to  be  awarded  shall  be  determined  on  the  basis  of  the  'Degree' Grade  Point  Average  (GPA)  as  set  out  in  the  Assessment  Regulations.    For  most programmes the Degree GPA is based on performance in Level II and III courses.
- 2. In determining the Degree GPA, the weights to be used for each Level I, II and III courses shall be as prescribed in The UWI Assessment Regulations for First Degrees, Associate Degrees, Undergraduate Diplomas and Certificates.
- 3. Level II and III courses shall have equal weight in the determination of the Degree GPA.
- 4. Core courses satisfying the requirements of specialization, majors and minors must be taken into account in determining the class of degree.
- 5. A  course  designated at  registration as  not  for  credit  (NFC)  shall not count  in  the determination of the Degree GPA.
- 6. The class of degree shall be determined as indicated in the table (Class of Degree Bands):

N.B. Graduate Programmes are not subject to the GPA regulations, as these programmes do not have GPAs.

## PART VII:  ACADEMIC SUPPORT SERVICES FOR ONLINE STUDENTS

<!-- image -->

## ACADEMIC SUPPORT SERVICES FROM THE PROGRAMME DELIVERY DEPARTMENT

The Open Campus has implemented academic support systems to ensure that students in online programmes/courses enjoy a meaningful virtual online learning experience, and that all their academic concerns are heard and addressed. Access to Online Academic Support is provided by the Programme Delivery Department in the Academic Programming and Delivery (APAD) division of the Open Campus (PDD/APAD). Some of the online support provided include: online orientation for new students; pre-course and programme advising conducted prior to the start of course registration; and access to various APAD support staff during course delivery and the opportunity to connect with other UWI Open Campus students virtually, across online programmes via the ' Connecting As Students' (CAS ) space .

## UWI Open Campus Orientation

How  you  begin  your  academic  studies  as  an  online  student  with  us  in  PDD  is  important,  so  we strongly encourage you to attend Online Orientation, by engaging in the online space. Attending and participating in our orientation activities online is the best way to acclimate to university life at The UWI Open Campus.

The online sessions will help you become familiar with the Campus, learn what your student life will be like, how to register for your first semester of online courses, as well as other important guidelines that will help you to function effectively for the duration of your programme. In addition, you will receive academic advisement, and meet persons who will be helpful to you during your programme of study.

## Online Orientation for New Undergraduate Students

Currently, there are four (4) phases to the online orientation exercise in which undergraduate students are encouraged to participate, in order to prepare for studying online.

-  All  new students in our online undergraduate programmes are required to participate in an Online Orientation. This may be done from the comfort of your home or you may use the computer facilities at your local UWI Open Campus Site or Learning Centres to gain access to the online sessions offered by the Programme Delivery Department (PDD).
-  To attend the Online Orientation, you must have a computer and Internet access.
-  New students should log on to the online orientation site, and listen to the videos, as well as read the Programme  Advising  documents  for  their respective programmes prior to registration - http://www.open.uwi.edu/undergraduate/programme-advising

Note: The Blackboard Collaborate (BbC) web conference tool works best with Google Chrome on desktop/ laptop . Users can download the mobile App as follows:

## Google Play Store -

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blackboard.android.bbstudent&amp;hl=en Apple App Store - https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bb-student/id950424861?mt=8 Windows - https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/bb-student/9nblggh08j8w

There is no need to configure or open an App. After downloading on the mobile device, just click on the meeting room link and it will launch the App.

Our orientation activities are developed for students to become more familiar with our online learning environment. Such activities teach students how to edit their profile pictures, how to add a discussion topic, how to reference sources accurately and how to upload an assignment. The orientation sessions last for approximately six weeks and are comprised of the following four phases:

## Phase 1 (Three weeks)

During Phase 1, students are engaged in the Introduction to the Learning Exchange (LE), that is, the Open Campus' online classroom. The aim of this phase is to assist students to develop the relevant navigational skills to work effectively in the online environment. During this phase, you will be able to  view  instructional  training  videos  on  how  to  utilise  the  various  features/components  of  the  LE. Students are encouraged to listen to the videos and practice the activities that follow.

## Phase 2 (Two weeks)

The focus of Phase 2 of the orientation is to provide you with academic programme advising. Students will be made aware of their programme structure through meetings with their Programme Managers and  other  staff  roles  and  members  in  PDD.  Through  these  meetings,  our  staff  tries  to  ensure  that students are prepared for the upcoming Registration period.

## Phase 3 (Three weeks)

All students are encouraged to complete the Programme Delivery Department's Orientation Course (PDDO) found on the LE. During this phase, students will be prepared for their 'academic journey' in the Learning Exchange. Students will be given the opportunity to demonstrate what was learnt during Phase 1 in the 'Introduction to the Learning Exchange' session. Students will be given activities that simulate  how  activities  are  conducted  in  an  actual  course.  These  activities  include  updating  of profiles, participating in quizzes,  uploading  assignments,  engaging  in  discussions  with  peers, reviewing how to use citations (referencing) in accordance with the referencing style for your specific programme, accessing emails, becoming familiar with The UWI plagiarism policy and many other important activities aimed at helping you achieve your academic goal.

## Phase 4 (approximately five days)

Phase 4 will commence at the start of the semester. During this period, students will interact with their Course Coordinators/Course Instructors and E-Tutors in their registered course space(s). The aim of this phase is to give you, our new students an induction to each course for which you have registered for the semester and an overview of what is expected of the learner/student.

For more information please visit http://www.open.uwi.edu/orientation

## Compulsory Induction to Online Study for Graduate Students

All  new  graduate  students  are  required  to  take  a  compulsory  course  (OOL)  on  admission  to  their postgraduate programme.  A designated online space is provided for this course.

Graduate Students (TLET ONLY): All admitted TLET postgraduate candidates must successfully complete a compulsory introductory course prior to registering for their courses in their first semester of their programme. This compulsory course, OOL6100 Graduate Introduction to Teaching and Learning with Emerging Technologies , is a two-part course. Part 1 introduces students to a self-paced orientation and assessment of technology tools used in the delivery of the programme. Part 2 is a facilitated module covering the programme objectives and expectations of graduate learners to prepare them for the demands of this UWI graduate programme.

Other Graduate Students: All other students in graduate programmes are required to register for the mandatory course OOL6001: Graduate Introduction to Online Learning, as a part of their induction to their  postgraduate  programme.  This  is  a  three-week  course  with  compulsory  activities  designed  to prepare  prospective  graduate  students  to  function  effectively  and  efficiently  in  a  fully  online programme.  Activities  are  given  to  students  not  only  to  show  that  they  can  function  in  the  online environment technically  but  also  academically  as  well.  Students  are  expected  to  perform  functions relating to online participation. You will interact with other learners, produce academic writing and understand how to source, evaluate and use information to meet the requirements of your programme. Additional information on this course can be found in your acceptance package.

## Pre-Course Programme Advising

Useful links are shown below. In addition, please visit our website, review your Programme Advising document and/or speak with your Programme Manager if you have any queries or require additional information:

- ● http://www.open.uwi.edu/admissions
- ● http://www.open.uwi.edu/pla/home

You  may  contact  your  Programme  Manager  (PM)  for  general  assistance  in  determining  which programme is suited to your learning needs.  The PM can also advise you on the programme's entry requirements  as  stated  in  the  relevant  programme  pages  on  the  UWIOC  website.   You  may  also remain in the comfort of your home and receive programme advising by using the online services provided  by  the  Programme  Delivery  Department  (PDD),  Academic  Programming  and  Delivery (APAD) Division. To do so, use the following options:

→ View the Programme Advising link for your online programme on the Open Campus website at: http://www.open.uwi.edu/ and locate your category of programme - i.e. Undergraduate, Graduate or CPE at: http://www.open.uwi.edu/undergraduate/home   or http://www.open.uwi.edu/pre-university-professional/home

→ Email Academic Support and correspond with a Course Delivery Assistant (CDA)  in  PDD/APAD  at:  academicsupport@open.uwi.edu    or  speak  to  us  on  Skype: Username -  uwioc\_academic\_support ~ Monday to Friday at 9:00 - 11:00 a.m. JA time/10 12:00 p.m. EC time.

## Online Programmes and Courses - APAD Staff Support

If  you  are  admitted  or  registered  in  an  online  programme  or  course  you  should  engage  with  the Academic  Programming  and  Delivery  (APAD)  Division.  The  following  APAD  staff  members  are available to help you in your academic studies online:

## Online Course Delivery

For courses delivered online, you have support on academic matters from the Programme Delivery Department (PDD) in APAD through the following roles:

## a) The Programme Manager

The Programme Manager (PM) provides academic guidance and support for the delivery of courses  and  programmes.    The  PM's  responsibility  is  to  ensure  that  all  courses  and programmes are delivered in accordance with the University's regulations. The PM also gives general programme advice, and serves as liaison between the university administrators and students;  monitors  the  performance  of  Course  Coordinators  and  Tutors  and  participates  in orientation activities with students.

Contact information for Programme Managers can be found on the programme information pages and Programme Advising pages of the Website (See Appendix C)

## b) Course Delivery Assistant (CDA) - Online Academic Support

In  an  effort  to  better  support  your  studies,  the  Open  Campus  utilizes  an  Academic  Support Team.  The aim of this team is to function as a sounding board on all issues impacting your teaching-learning experience in our online learning environment.  The CDA team members will complement your Course Coordinator and eTutors, who should continue to be your first line of support for academic studies.

## c)  Learning Support Specialist (LSS) - Online support with technology

To support your technology in the online course a LSS is assigned to each course. The LSS works  as  part  of  a  team  with  your  PM,  CDA,  and  Facilitators  (CC/CI  and  eTutors/Group Facilitators) to provide you with an enriching learning experience.

## Teaching-Learning  in  the  Learning  Exchange  (LE)  -  Online  Course Delivery

## Course Coordinator/Course Instructor

The  Course  Coordinator  is  the  online  instructor  responsible  for  the  course.  During  online  course delivery,  you  will  interact  with  both  the  Course  Coordinator  and  the  eTutor  but  will  work  more closely  with  the  eTutor  in  small  groups  (Undergraduate  10-34;  Graduate  10-25).  The  Course Coordinator,  who  is  the  lead  course  facilitator,  can  be  contacted  online  in  the  LE  to  discuss  any course-related issues. He/She will also provide contact information, whether by email or Skype in the student 'Course Guide' found in the LE. This arrangement is similar to face-to face delivery, where you generally interact with the instructor and it is possible to ask questions before, during, or after classes or to set up meetings outside of class time.  When there is a small number of students, and only one facilitator is required, the person who leads the course is called a Course Instructor (CI).

## Course Tutor/ Group Facilitator

The  eTutors/  Group  Facilitators  assist  you  in  improving  your  knowledge  of  the  specific  subject area.  They also promote independent learning and clarify and elaborate on challenging concepts; and in this way, help you to master requisite competencies.  Interaction with tutors online is essential as this  will  afford  you  the  opportunity  to  clarify  understanding  of  the  subject,  ask  questions,  share concerns, and participate actively in small group discussions.  eTutors/ Group Facilitators will discuss assignments,  mark  them,  provide  feedback,  and  assist  in  preparation  for  mid  and  end-of-semester examinations.  In online courses, attendance and grades are recorded online.

## Course Issues

In undergraduate online courses your first point of contact is your eTutor, and in graduate courses the Group Facilitator (GF). However, if you are having problems with an ineffective or non-responsive eTutor/ Group Facilitator then you should contact your Course Coordinator.  His or her contact information is available on the front page of each course and in the Course Guide. Note also, that all staff may be contacted using firstname.lastname@open.uwi.edu

## How to Contact Your Course Coordinator/Course Instructor

- 1. You may contact your Course Coordinator/Instructor by posting messages in the forums via the Learning Exchange.  It is important to use this forum as it also allows the CDA and PDD to evaluate the quality service you are receiving in each course group.
- 2. You may also e-mail  your  Course  Coordinator/Instructor  using  the  contact information provided in the  Course Guide (not his/her private email). A messaging system that  allows  you  to  communicate  with  your  Course  Coordinator  is  also  available  via  the Learning Exchange (LE).

Note: Correspondence between students and facilitators on course related matters must take place in the  LE,  or  an  approved  UWI  Open  Campus technology source (e.g. OC email, Web Conferencing BbC).

## Reporting a Problem

If  the  Course  Coordinator  fails  to  solve  the  problem  or  does  not  respond  to  your  request  for  help within  twenty-four  hours,  you  should  request  the  assistance  of  the  CDA  by  way  of  the  PDD's Academic Support email. The team of  CDAs in PDD will investigate the issue. You should write directly to Academic Support at academicsupport@open.uwi.edu

The  reference  chart  below  outlines  the  correct  protocol  for  reporting  academic  issues  that  are encountered in the Learning Exchange.

<!-- image -->

A reporting option is available on your main online course page:

-  On the course page click the 'Academic Support' tab at the bottom of your course page in the Learning Exchange to send an email to Academic Support for assistance.  Clearly state the course name and code, the specific problem you wish to report, and the names of your Course Coordinator and eTutor, so you may receive prompt assistance.  The Academic Support Team will investigate your case and provide you with a status report within twenty-four 24 hours of receiving your message.
-  If you are outside the course space, you may send an email to the members of the Academic Support Team at academicsupport@open.uwi.edu
-  You may also speak with a Course Delivery Assistant during the weekdays Monday-Friday, on Skype (username: uwioc\_academic\_support) during the hours of 10:00 a.m. - 12:00 Noon EC Time/ 9:00 -11:00 a.m. Jamaica Time.

Please  ensure  that  you  send  emails  using  your  Open  Campus  email  address  and  include information  such  as  your  name,  student  ID  number,  course  name  and  course  code  in  your correspondence. Please also ensure that a copy of all correspondence on online course matters is sent  to  your  Programme  Manager.    Email  addresses  of  all  Programme  Managers  are  listed  in Appendix C.

ONLINE PROTOCOL: When communicating online, be reminded to pay attention to the following online protocol: (1) When you send an email always check to see if your email was correctly sent (not sitting in your draft box) or whether it 'bounced'. A bounced mail sends an error message, indicating the address is incorrect and not received by the intended party. (2) Check if the response indicates if the person is not available and follow the instructions provided in the automatic responder.

## How to Contact Your Head of Department - Online Programmes

The Head of the Programme Delivery Department, Dr. Yasmeen Yusuf-Khalil, may be contacted at: yasmeen.yusuf-khalil@open.uwi.edu

## Connecting As Students (CAS)

As a registered student, you have the opportunity to engage as students, not only within your course but  also  across  programmes  through  the  forum Connecting  As  Students (CAS)  space.  CAS  is  The UWI Open Campus community forum space for all registered undergraduate and postgraduate online students. The purpose of this space is to bridge the digital divide across all categories of students by giving  students  the  opportunity  to  communicate  with  each  other  virtually  to  share  ideas,  to  seek information from peers; to post questions and receive feedback; and to participate in general studentto-student  engagement.  Registered  students,  after  gaining  access  to  their  courses,  may  access  this CAS space by clicking the link found in their courses on the Learning Exchange.
