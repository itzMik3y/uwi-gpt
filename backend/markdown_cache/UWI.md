ICT Initiatives and Innovation at UWI

-  UWI is  one  of  only  two  universities  around the  world  whose  operations  transcend  the borders of multiple nation states.
-  UWI's operations conducted in forty-five educational sites in sixteen countries place a premium on the use of information technology to enhance the effectiveness of its learning and administrative processes.

Recent UWI ICT Initiatives

-  Learning Management System  Development of Teaching and Learning Spaces
-  Use of Web Based Synchronous Communications
-  Development of Student Portals
-  Integrated Information Services  Administrative Support Systems
-  Access to Research and Education Networks
-  Single Virtual University Space Initiative

Learning Management System

-  A  learning  management  system  is  a  software  application  that facilitates  access  to  learning  resources  and  content  and  therefore

permits internet-based course delivery.

-  All  UWI  campuses  run  the  Moodle  learning  management  system, which  is  an  Open  Source  application.  The  UWI  LMS  is  used  to deliver fully on-line programmes as well as to augment traditional classroom  teaching  by  providing  a  shared  space  for  faculty  and students  to  post materials  and  encourage  communication  and collaboration outside of regular class times.



The

LMS

contains

discussion

forums

for

student-teach

- collaboration, calendar, real time chat tools, online quizz and exam functionality, blogs and drop-box features for assignment submission.

Teaching and Learning Spaces

-  During  the  last two  strategic planning  periods,  in particular, UWI has focused on enhancing the technological sophistication of its teaching and learning spaces.
-  Across the University, classrooms have been upgraded with  multimedia  technological  access.  Many  lecture theatres  allow  the  use  of  digital  information  and  in several programmes lectures are streamed over broadband for wide are learning.



Currently,  technologies  under  investigation,  and  pilot,

- include  response  and  web-based  polling  that  allows students to respond to interactive polling questions.

Use of Web-Based Synchronous Communication

-  UWI uses standard synchronous applications such as Elluminate and BigblueButton to deliver online courses and provide real time communication for educational and administrative purposes.
-  Web-conferencing increases interactivity not available on asynchronous tools.



Elluminate is the preferred web-conferencing tool

- of UWI's Open Campus. Bigblue Button is currently used by UWI, Mona's Medical Faculty.

Development of Student Portals

-  UWI has recently developed or upgraded student portals. The integrated  student  portal  (my.uwi.edu)  is  a  university-wide initiative which  allows  for single sign-on access to the electronic student information system (banner), the moodle learning  management  system,  email,  library  resources  and other applications. The student portal was recently upgraded to allow for deployment on mobile devices.
-  A  graduate  student  information  portal  (Graduate  Research Information Portal, GRIP) was recently launched.



Many UWI departments are developing interactive websites

- with blogging capabilities, for example the Quality Assurance Unit recently launched such a website.

Integrated Information Services

-  The  focal  point  of  UWI's  information  services  is  a  library

system that is integrated right across the UWI.

-  In October 2011, UWI launched its UWI Libraries' Information Connexion (UWIlinC( knowledge portal. UWIlinC  consolidates  disparate  library  collections  into  one systems and, thereby provides students and staff instanteous access to a range of library material including digitized print, audio, video and images from all the libraries across all four UWI campuses via a single web space.



For external parties, the new UWIlinC portal opens a window

- to UWI's  extensive  range  of  unique  Caribbean  scholarly resources.

Administrative Support Systems

-  Over the last several years, UWI has focused on  ensuring  that  all  administrative  support systems  and  student-interface  systems  are on-line. These  include on-line application and  student  registration  and  on-line  human resource and financial systems.
-  The  systems  in  use  include  Banner  Student and Finance Enterprise applications and People Soft Human  Capital Management Support Systems.

Access to Research and Education Networks

-  At UWI's St. Augustine and Cave Hill Campuses, students and  staff  have  access  to  high  speed  dedicated  network connections such as Internet2, which link research networks with peer networks all over the world to support science and engineering research.
-  UWI  has  invested  in  a  router  (colocated)  in  Network Access  Point  of  Americas  in  Miami  which  will  facilitate additional inter-connectivity of its campuses.



UWI  is

collaborating

with

C@ribnet

(the

Caribbean

- Regional  Research  and  Education  Network)  to  provide additional interconnectivity between UWI, National Research and Education Networks  (NRENS)  and  the international research networks.

Single Virtual University Space Initiative

-  All of UWI's ICT initiatives are being brought together under the rubric of the SVUS, which is a cyber platform dedicated to enabling  students  anywhere  in  the  University  to  access  the best teaching and learning resources available at the University.
-  The SVUS is perceived as an institutional extension medium which will provide the platform that consolidates the ICT and ODL  operations  on  one  cyber  platform,  allowing  UWI  to provide  one  stop  student  services  to  all  students,  including those  not  registered  at  one  of  its  residential  campuses, through  the  operations  of  UWI's  Open  Campus,  which  was launched five years ago to dramatically improve UWI's access to students from across all its contributing territories.
