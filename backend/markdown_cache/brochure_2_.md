## Welcome by the Pro Vice Chancellor for Graduate Studies

Welcome to the School for Graduate Studies and Research and congratulations on having decided to pursue graduate education.

In  these  financially  parlous  times  this  may  be  the  best  investment  that  you  could have made. For 'developing' countries to truly develop, graduate education at the highest professional and academic levels, benchmarked to international standards, must be strengthened and must flourish.  The ability to ask critical questions, both fundamental  and  applied,  to  seek  novel,  contextually  appropriate  yet  universally applicable solutions and to communicate your findings with clarity and cogency are integral components of good graduate education. The attainment of these skills is the  goal  towards  which  all  of  our  students  must  work  and  which  the  School undertakes to target in all its programmes. We trust that you will help us to focus on these essential targets irrespective of the field of scholarship you pursue, since it is only through your achievements that we can measure our success.

So, as we strive to develop a cadre of outstanding, committed and student centered faculty and to strengthen our programmes, we look to you to for the commitment, the collaborative spirit and the constant feedback that will lift you, your School and your University to the highest levels of performance.

## Welcome  by  the  Pro  Vice  Chancellor  for  Graduate  Studies (Research)

It  gives  me  great  pleasure  to  welcome  all  of  you  at  the  start  of  the  2009-2010 Academic  Year,  although  my  remarks  may  be  more  applicable  to  those  of  you pursuing  research  degrees,  for  I  wish  to  impress  upon  you  the  importance  of research  to  our  University  and  region.    Research  generates  the  knowledge,  the critical thinkers, the policy advice and the innovative links to business necessary for regional economic development and enhanced quality of life.  Research also ensures that  UWI  remains,  and  is  recognized  as,  a  player  in  the  international  pursuit  of knowledge.    Research  rejuvenates  our  teaching  programmes  and  enhances  their quality and relevance, it allows us to set and lead the standards of scholarship in our region,  and  it  provides  us  with  the  capacity  to  generate  university  income  in  a fiercely competitive international arena.  As graduate students, you are central to our efforts to achieve these goals.  It is our responsibility to provide the enabling environment  necessary  for  you  to  realise  your  full  potential  and  conduct  your research  at  the  highest  possible  standard.    It  is  your  responsibility  to  commit yourself to this goal and ensure that it is realised.  Communicate with us whenever you feel the need for support.  I wish you a pleasurable, productive and successful academic year.

## GENERAL INFORMATION ON THE UNIVERSITY

The  University  of  the  West  Indies  is  one  of  the  institutions  of  higher education founded in one of the former British colonies just after the Second World  War.    It  began  in  October  1948  as  a  University  College  preparing students for degrees of the University of London.  On April 2, 1962, it became a degree-granting University in its own right.

There are three Campuses - Cave Hill in Barbados, Mona in Jamaica, and St Augustine  in  Trinidad.    Cave  Hill  is  3,800  kilometres  from  Mona,  while  St Augustine is approximately 5,320 kilometres from Mona.

The Vice Chancellors office is currently located at the Mona Campus, as are those of the Director of Administration/University Registrar, and the Director of  Finance/University Bursar.   The Offices of the Board for Undergraduate Studies and the Dean of the School for Graduate Studies &amp; Research are also located at Mona.

## HISTORY OF THE MONA CAMPUS

The  Mona  Campus  is  located  in  St  Andrew.    Jamaica's  population  is approximately 2.5 million, with over one million living in Kingston, the capital city.    Kingston  is  the  seat  of  the  government  and  much  of  the  island's commercial, industrial and cultural activities, and boasts the seventh largest natural harbour in the world.

The  Campus  is  situated  on  653  acres  of  land  made  available  by  the Government of Jamaica.  Previously two sugar estates, it is rich in historical remains from this era.  During World War II, parts of Mona were used as a camp to house persons evacuated from Malta and Gibraltar.  At the end of

the War, the evacuees and the military moved out and the buildings erected for their occupation remained empty.  The site and buildings were offered by the Jamaican Government and accepted as a home for the University until permanent buildings were constructed.  Some of the original  buildings are still in use today.

## CLIMATE

The climate  is  tropical,  the  weather  being  mostly  dry  and  sunny.    It  is  hot during the day throughout most of the year with temperatures ranging from 26 to 32 degrees Celsius in the day, to night time temperatures of 20 to 30 degrees.  Umbrellas are necessary for the rainy season which occurs in May and October.

The Campus is some eleven kilometres from the centre of Kingston. It is a raised  valley  in  the  foothills  of  the  Blue  Mountains  and,  as  a  result  of  its elevation, the temperature on Campus is cooler than elsewhere in Kingston.

Light  clothing  is  worn  and  summer  clothing  is  generally  suitable  all  year round.

## INTRODUCTION TO GRADUATE STUDIES

Graduate  studies  at  The  University  of  the  West  Indies  (UWI)  can  be undertaken  in  the  form  of taught  courses or research. Within  each department you will find details of the programmes currently being offered.

The University of the West Indies

## TAUGHT PROGRAMMES

Some of the taught programmes offered at the Mona Campus are the Master of Arts (MA), the Master of Library &amp; Information Studies (MLS), EMBA, MBA, the  Master  of  Science  (MSc)  in  Human  Resource  Development  (HRD), Management  Information  Systems  (MIS),  Natural  Resource  Management (NRM), Digital Technology, Plant Production and Protection, Nursing, Clinical Psychology,  and  Master  of  Public  Health  (MPH).    These  degrees  consist mainly of lectures, coursework and either a project or a dissertation/research paper.  The  Master  in  Education  (M.Ed.)  through  a  project  involves  a substantial research component.

## By Distance

The  School  for  Graduate  Studies  &amp;  Research  at  Mona  will  offer  Distance Education programmes in MSc Counselling, Master in Education (MEd) and MSc in Family Medicine.

## DM PROGRAMMES

Full time degree programmes leading to the award of Doctorate in Medicine (DM) are offered in all specialties.

All programmes aim at providing exit qualifications at Consultant Level.

## RESEARCH DEGREES

The principal research degrees are Master of Philosophy (MPhil) and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD). In addition, the Faculty of Medical Sciences offers the Doctor  of  Medicine  (DM) . Research  Degrees  involve  independent  study, assisted  by  a  Supervisor,  and  the  production  of  a  thesis.    The  essential difference between the Master and Doctoral levels, apart from the length of

the  registration  period,  lies  in  the  quality  of  a  successful  PhD  thesis.  This must  be  judged  to  be  the  result  of  original  research,  to  be  an  addition  to knowledge and to be worthy of publication either in full or in an abridged form.  The award of a PhD degree also requires that a candidate defend their thesis at a public oral examination.

Many  research  degrees  now  contain  a  taught  element.    The  intention  of these courses is to provide students with research techniques and skills that will not  only  help  them  to  complete  their  current  research  topic,  but strengthen their practical application skills for life after university.

With the exception of holders of MPhil degrees from recognised universities, a candidate for the PhD degree is normally required to register for the MPhil Degree in the first instance.  If you and the Department are pleased with the progress, then provisions exist to transfer a registration from the Master's to Doctoral level without first submitting a Master's dissertation.

A  candidate  whose  qualifications  are  not  of  the  required  standard,  or sufficiently related to the proposed subject of study may be required to pass a qualifying examination or take relevant departmental courses.

We  recognise  the  considerable  personal  and  financial  investment  that students  make  in  deciding  to  pursue  a  higher  degree  and  it  is  extremely important that the choice made suits one's individual needs and preferences. If you decide to pursue a research degree, it is also important that the thesis topic chosen is of genuine and sustainable interest.

Course Description:

## MC66B - Behaviour Change and Communication Theories

The  course  will  focus  on  complex  phenomena  and processes  expressing  themselves  at  various  levels. Changes in behaviour, at the individual as well as the group or community levels, will be approached from a systems  perspective,  in  which  key  institutional agents  will  be  looked  at.  The  main  objective  of  the course  is to increase  students'  understanding  of evidence-based social and behaviour change processes and some of the theoretical challenges and solutions  that  have  been  identified  in  facilitating  or triggering change. The course provides the foundation for the courses that follow in the program, including Development Communication and Communication Analysis and Planning.

## MC68B - Research Methods in Communication for Social and Behaviour Change

This  course  compliments the Behaviour Change and Communication Theories course and is taken in the same  semester.  Research  approaches  will  reflect  a similarly comprehensive  perspective  and  consider the  'contextual  domain'.  This  means  that  students will become familiar with a range of research interventions,  including  quantitative  and  qualitative

methods and will be required to design and execute modest research projects using these methods. They will  also  learn  to  combine  both  methods  over  time and make findings an integral part of developing new interventions  and  making  suggestions  for  policy,  as well as strengthening existing programmes. Students will also learn to critically analyze current research in the field of communication for social and behaviour change.

## MC67B - Academic Reading and Writing in the Study and Analysis of Communication

This  course  prepares  students  to  analyse  and produce  writing  that  meets  the  requirements  of graduate level work in analysing communication. Through continuous reading and writing exercises on issues central to understanding communication, students will improve their skills in selecting and evaluating the scholarly material used  in  the  field  of  communication.  During  the course,  students  will  also  be  introduced  to  the major  journals  in  communication,  including  the American and European Schools of Communication  Studies.    They  will  also  learn how to use and cite bibliographic material according to the American Psychological Association  format  standard  in  Communication Studies as well as to integrate graphics and tables into their work for seminar and conference presentations. Each week, students will be assigned examples of academic writing in analysing communication.   This course provides the graduate student with an important grounding in  achieving  the  standards  of  academic  writing

and reading required for successful completion of course requirements for papers, as well as presentations, and the Research Paper due at the end of the programme.

## MC68A - Social Change and Development Communication

The course will trace the role of theory and research related  to  information  used  to  address  problems  of social change and development programmes. Students will understand what is meant by the term Social Change and Development Communication with views from various society change agents. They will be guided through the principles of social change and development communication from various perspectives.    The  course  examines  how  grassroots and participatory strategies are being combined with communication technologies to promote social change in developing country contexts. The effectiveness of communication strategies (interpersonal,  mass,  and  the  Internet)  to  address problems where change in attitudes or behaviour is called for will be discussed. A special topic of consideration will be the role of communication and information technology in development programmes or  plans  with  a  focus  on  the  best  practices  in  the Caribbean.

## MC67A - Communication Analysis and Planning

This  course  exposes  the  student  to  the  practical applications of communication  as  a  tool in the

## The University of the West Indies

development process. Following on from the preceding  courses  in  the  programme,  in  this  course development embraces the human, social, environmental, economic and political processes which bring about change  and improvement  of human  conditions  and  an  empowerment  of  the individual to harness  that  change  to  his  or  her advantage. In this process the role which communication  plays  becomes  very  central.    The course  introduces  students  to  the  practical  skills  in developing communication support projects as integral parts of a development programme  or strategy. In-class assignments take a case-study approach,  using  teamwork  as  well  as  opportunities for  individual  skills  development,  in  order  to  allow the student greater understanding of and facility with how  communication  approaches  and  methods  are integral to effective development programme design. On completion of the course, the student should be able to design workable communication for development programmes for specific situations and needs.

## MC68C - Disasters, Media and Communication

The  purpose  of  the  course  is  to  acquaint  students with contemporary theory, research and practice of risk communication. The course treats 'risk communication' as a complex challenge that requires a careful understanding of science, the mass media, stakeholder roles, ideologies, and lay conceptions of danger. As professionals, risk

communicators  assist  government,  industry,  health and activist organizations to produce documents and media  campaigns.  They  inform  interdisciplinary  and lay audiences about health and environmental hazards, risks, and preparedness. The course recognises  that,  health  specialists,  communications managers,  scientist,  engineer,  lawyers,  government, and non-profit organisations and other professionals who  face  risk  communication  challenges  involving the  lay  public  need  a  solid  understanding  of  risk communication and the issues involved and how to better manage risk communication within their organisations.

## MC69A  - Intervention Design

This course is designed to train students in the design of strategically planned, social and behavioural change communication interventions.  It emphasizes the need to plan sound interventions and reviews the strategic planning steps that are required for persuasive or participatory approaches. Additionally, it recognizes that 'strategic communication' can go a long way in supporting and deepening the impact of other programmatic interventions and seeks to define the proper role and strength of communication in broader development activities.

## MC60B - Caribbean Media, Communication and Society

The course aims at developing a broad knowledge of Caribbean  media  and  communication  systems  and

develops the student's knowledge of the relationship between communication and culture in the Caribbean, particularly with respect to media influences on culture.

## MC670 - Graduate Seminars: Contemporary Issues in Communication for Behaviour and Social Change

The goal of this course is to illustrate the importance of communication  for social and behaviour change, focusing on the application of communication  models  and  strategies  in  health, social and other development fields. The seminar will serve  as a forum  for  discussing  current research in communication  and  change from various  perspectives.  It  will  provide  a  platform for  students  to  begin  planning  their  final  year research projects.  The course is designed to help students  to  develop  an  awareness  of  relevant current research in the field of social and behaviour change. It will also facilitate the presentation  of  research  proposals  for  feedback and  discussion  before  final  approval  and  inform students  about  university  regulations  regarding final research projects.

## MC660 - Final Research Paper

The goal of the final project, which is referred to as a Research Project/Research Paper, is to demonstrate students'  understanding  of  application  of  theory, research  methods  and  other  skills  acquired  in  the classroom. The project will be a challenging piece of

The University of the West Indies work that integrates concepts and skills. Approval of project proposals is required before proceeding with the project or research.

The principal objective of the teaching programme of the Department of History and Archaeology is to provide a thorough understanding of Caribbean history, heritage and  culture,  as  well  as  the  broader  currents  of  world  history  which  have  helped shape  the  region.    Accordingly,  the  Department's  courses  focus  not  only  on  the Caribbean but also on Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America and North America, and on the methodologies of history, archaeology, and heritage.

In fulfilling this objective, the Department fosters knowledge and understanding of history,  heritage,  and  archaeology  at  the  graduate  and  undergraduate  levels  and seeks to develop students' analytical skills and professionalism.

The Department conducts original scholarly research and pursues effective teaching and learning practices.  Both address regional and international issues and provide frameworks for demonstrating the relevance of the past to the present.

The Department also promotes links with professional groups and institutions,  as well as with the wider community.

in be

The University of the West Indies A selective survey of recent developments phonological and syntax theory. Topics to surveyed will be chosen from among the following:

Natural  generative  phonology,  psychological  reality in  phonology,  the  relationship  between  phonology and  syntax,  extended  standard  theory,  Chomsky's theories  of  filters  and  binding,  relational  grammar, case grammar, functional syntax and Montague grammar.

## L601- Linguistics Universals and Typology

A study of selected topics in phonology, morphology, syntax  and  semantics.    The  emphasis  will  be  crosslinguistics comparison, with data drawn from a wide range  of  languages.    Subjects  to  be  examined  will include tonology, implicational universals in phonology, word  order, relative cause, animacy, causatives, tense and aspect, definiteness, quantification and modality.

## L610- Selected Topics in Caribbean Language Structure

Students will be encouraged to apply the theoretical apparatus acquired in L20A, L20B, L20E and L600 and L601  to  Caribbean  data.    The  question  of  variation will be down played and Caribbean languages will be view as ideal systems. Topics will be selected from:

- · Morphophonemic alternation, phonotactic features
- · Tense, aspect, modality
- · Verb Serialization
- · Negatives
- · Passive
- · Relativisation
- · Topicatlisation
- · Morpheme classes
- · Semantic deep structures

## L620- Dynamics of Language Variation

The course will discuss various approaches to language variation using Caribbean language phenomena as the main illustrations.  It will look at the history of variation studies, beginning briefly with linguistic  geography,  structural  dialectology  and  the break  with  monolithic  assumptions  of  generative grammar.

## The following major areas will be covered.

- · Historical comparative variation as a foundation for current variation
- · Variable rules
- · Quantitative methods in Sociolinguistics, correlations with non-linguistics data
- · Implicational grammar
- · Polylectal grammar

## L630- The Structure of Caribbean English(es)

The  course  will  focus  on  the  very  important  but largely unstudied field of acrolectal speech (in continuum situation) and 'educated speech' (Trinidad,  Barbados).    It  will  study  processes  and

criteria of language standardization and especially of the emergence of variant regional norms of standard language (American English, Canadian French, Indian English etc.) and will then look at the structure of the emerging West Indian norms.  Since there is virtually no work on this later area, this part of the course will largely  be  of  the  'Workshop'  type  devoted  to  the discovery of the structure of the West Indian English.

## L640- Theoretical Issues in Applied Linguistics

This course will be concerned with in-depth examination of selected topic from current research on language usage and language acquisition. Whenever possible, illustrations  will  be  drawn  from the  Caribbean.    Topics  will  include  the  study  of language in context (e.g. Speech Act Theory, Conversational Implications, Conversational Analysis) as  well  as  the  roles  of  cognitive  process,  language function  and  language  structure  in  the  linguistics development of young children and issues in second language acquisition theory (e.g. processes involved , the  role  of  particular  variables  such  as  age,  first language  input,  effective  variables).    The  relation between  the  above-mentioned  subjects  and  recent approaches  to  language  teaching  will  be  discussed, with reference to teaching of English and of Foreign Languages in the Caribbean context.  Relevant topics in  this  area  will  include  the  teaching  of  language  as communication and the role of grammar in language teaching.

The University of the West Indies

We will also examine current conceptual, ontological, epistemological, and methodological issues in philosophy of social science; critically subjecting to philosophical analysis the nature of generalizations and prediction in the social sciences; the place of reasons versus causes, interpretation and meaning of social phenomena.  We will also carefully examine such concepts and issues as intentionality, explanation of action, reductionism, supervenience, individualism versus holism, objectivity, realism, subjectivism, objectivism, relativism, facts vs. values, feminism, postmodernism, sociology of philosophy and knowledge.  This course will examine the age of ideology and examine the post-ideology age; as well as the place of education in socio-political engineering, while enabling students to understand the arguments for indoctrination versus coercion in political arena. Special attention will be paid to the contemporary African Diaspora existentialist political philosophy, especially as articulated by Fanon, Rodney, Charles Mills, Gordon R. Lewis, Paget Henry and others.

Each student must complete an M. A. Dissertation/Research Paper, which shall not exceed 20,000  words and  be  successfully  examined  before they are awarded the degree of M. A. in Philosophy. It is expected that each student will submit a Proposal to the Department at the beginning of their Second  Semester  on  the  Programme  (for  Full  Time Students and Third Semester for Part Time Students) and have it discussed and approved by a Supervisor before  the  end  of  the  Second  Semester.    This  is  to ensure that students who pass the Examinations are facilitated  to  complete  the  programme  within  the stipulated time frame.

The University of the West indies

## Course Description:

## L600- Issues in Syntax and Phonology

A selective survey of recent developments in phonological and syntax theory. Topics to be surveyed will be chosen from among the following:

Natural  generative  phonology,  psychological  reality in  phonology,  the  relationship  between  phonology and  syntax,  extended  standard  theory,  Chomsky's theories  of  filters  and  binding,  relational  grammar, case grammar, functional syntax and Montague grammar.

## L601- Linguistics Universals and Typology

A study of selected topics in phonology, morphology, syntax  and  semantics.    The  emphasis  will  be  crosslinguistics comparison, with data drawn from a wide range  of  languages.    Subjects  to  be  examined  will include tonology, implicational universals in phonology, word  order, relative cause, animacy, causatives, tense and aspect, definiteness, quantification and modality.

## L610- Selected Topics in Caribbean Language Structure

Students will be encouraged to apply the theoretical apparatus acquired in L20A, L20B, L20E and L600 and L601  to  Caribbean  data.    The  question  of  variation will be down played and Caribbean languages will be view as ideal systems. Topics will be selected from:

- · Morphophonemic alternation, phonotactic features
- · Tense, aspect, modality
- · Verb Serialization
- · Negatives
- · Passive
- · Relativisation
- · Topicatlisation
- · Morpheme classes
- · Semantic deep structures

## L620- Dynamics of Language Variation

The course will discuss various approaches to language variation using Caribbean language phenomena as the main illustrations.  It will look at the history of variation studies, beginning briefly with linguistic  geography,  structural  dialectology  and  the break  with  monolithic  assumptions  of  generative grammar.

The following major areas will be covered.

- · Historical comparative variation as a foundation for current variation
- · Variable rules
- · Quantitative methods in Sociolinguistics, correlations with non-linguistics data

- · Implicational grammar
- · Polylectal grammar

## L630- The Structure of Caribbean English(es)

The  course  will  focus  on  the  very  important  but largely unstudied field of acrolectal speech (in continuum situation) and 'educated speech' (Trinidad,  Barbados).    It  will  study  processes  and criteria of language standardization and especially of the emergence of variant regional norms of standard language (American English, Canadian French, Indian English etc.) and will then look at the structure of the emerging West Indian norms.  Since there is virtually no work on this later area, this part of the course will largely  be  of  the  'Workshop'  type  devoted  to  the discovery of the structure of the West Indian English.

## L640- Theoretical Issues in Applied Linguistics

This course will be concerned with in-depth examination of selected topic from current research on language usage and language acquisition. Whenever possible, illustrations  will  be  drawn  from the  Caribbean.    Topics  will  include  the  study  of language in context (e.g. Speech Act Theory, Conversational Implications, Conversational Analysis) as  well  as  the  roles  of  cognitive  process,  language function  and  language  structure  in  the  linguistics

The University of the West Indies development of young children and issues in second language acquisition theory (e.g. processes involved , the  role  of  particular  variables  such  as  age,  first language  input,  effective  variables).    The  relation between  the  above-mentioned  subjects  and  recent approaches  to  language  teaching  will  be  discussed, with reference to teaching of English and of Foreign Languages in the Caribbean context.  Relevant topics in  this  area  will  include  the  teaching  of  language  as communication and the role of grammar in language teaching.

## Course Description

## LITS 6001 (E60A) Twentieth Century Literary Theory

This course examines the development and range of literary theory in the 20th century, with consideration of the nature and function of theory, and the ways in which theories define themselves in relation and contradistinction to other theories. There will be close attention to a selection of topics from the following: New Criticism, Marxist theory, Structuralism, Northrop Frye, Mikhail Bakhtin, Deconstruction, New Historicism, Feminist theory, African-American theory, Postcolonial theory, Caribbean theory.

## LITS 6026 (E60Z) Research and Writing for Publication

The purpose of this course is to provide students with information and skills to ensure a basic and necessary competence in both general and subjectspecific research practice, and a sound foundation in the documentation and writing practices necessary for literary scholarship. The course will seek to meet those needs, and will be compulsory for all new graduate students.

## LITS 6105 (E61E) Postcolonial Literatures and Theories I

This course will discuss selected postcolonial authors and theorists. Imaginative and theoretical works will be read alongside each other as way of shedding light on Diana Brydon and Helen Tiffin's claim that postcolonial literatures represent 'decolonising' fictions. Using Brydon and Tiffin's theory text, Decolonising  Fictions, as  a  model  of  comparative analysis,  this  course  will  test  the  counter-discursive assumptions  of  postcolonial  theory.  The  course  will highlight the issue of hegemony as a primary concept in postcolonial studies and interrogate the hegemonies  of  race,  culture,  gender  and  sexuality from works chosen from three different postcolonial sites.  Essentially,  this  course  seeks  to  answer  the question:  what  are  the  strengths  or  weaknesses  of conceiving  of  postcolonial  literatures  as  a  field  of comparative  study  and  as  ideologically  driven  by counter-discursive impulses?

## LITS 6203 (E62C) Women, Poetry and Gender

This course undertakes a reading of the work of women poets in an era when gender, race, and cultural issues have converged to create the discourse within which women poets must function. The work of individual poets will be considered in relation to the formal theoretical issues raised by this

discourse and by the on-going attempts by women writers to shape the medium of poetry to their specific purposes.

## Additional Information/Notes:

The Department will admit new MPhil and PhD students for the academic year 2009-2010, but no new MA students will be admitted into the programme for this year.  Continuing MA students will complete their courses and/or Research Paper.

CREDITS:

## Rationale:

The management of human resources is probably the most important tasks in any organization, for whether the purpose is to produce goods or services such productivity is made possible through the human elements.

Many organization have a separate Human Resource (Personnel) department with an assigned manager who is responsible for its personnel functions, but in the school, the principal assumes the important role of Human Resource or Manager.  The success of any school programme depends to a large extent, on the efficiency of the principal in selecting and deploying, developing and supervising human resources so as to maximize achievement of the goals of the school.

This module on personnel management (Human Resources Management/Personnel) introduces you to the various personnel roles in the school, and the skills and techniques employed in the performance of such roles.

## EDUCATIONAL  LEADERSHIP

Rationale:

Educational institutions today are forced to change programmes in order to prepare workers for an international economy and citizens for a turbulent and pluralistic culture.  Educational leaders therefore

need to keep abreast of the changing demands of society and develop the knowledge and skills necessary to effectively guide their organization towards meeting these demands.

This course is designed to assist participants in acquiring an in depth understanding of the nature, scope and purpose of leadership as it relates to educational administration and to acquire skills for effective leadership.

## Rationale:

This is an introductory course in the area of Educational Planning aimed at enabling participants to develop an understanding of the functions, principles, processes and strategies of educational planning.

In the context of developing countries where resources are scare, those who manage educational systems and organizations can benefit greatly from the study of this course as they seek to deal with some of the dilemmas that confront them.

## EDUCATIONAL SUPERVISION

COURSE CODE:

ED63H

DURATION:

39 HOURS -1 SEMESTER

CREDITS:

Rationale:

Supervision and administration are correlative, complementary and mutually shared functions in the management of educational systems.  It is inconceivable that a specialization in Educational Administration could be considered exclusive of supervision.  Further, in our school systems the Educational Officer, the Principal, the Vice Principal, Department Head among others perform the role of supervisor.  As supervisory leaders these individuals must be educated and trained so that they can better coordinate and facilitate the work of teachers in their efforts to improve the learning of pupils and the work of the school.

## Rationale:

The nature of thinking and learning and the creation of meaning have been central concerns of educators for many years, generating a number of theories and considerable research work.  Those responsible for structuring and determining learning experiences should not only be well informed about the processes of cognition and concept learning, but should also have a lively interest in contemporary research in this field and the applicability of both theory and research findings to the practical teaching situation.

For teachers to be effective in the classroom they need to have knowledge of concept teaching and learning, as every subject matter is built around concepts.  Concepts

The University of the West Indies also serve to organize the experiences of the learners,

as well as order how they reflect on these experiences.

COURSE TITLE:

Human Growth and

Development

COURSE CODE:

ED60K

DURATION:

39 Hours - 1 Semester

CREDITS:

Rationale:

Knowledge of human growth and development is of great importance to educators, parents and the individuals themselves.  While an understanding of growth and development up to early adulthood can enhance one's understanding of the school aged child, an appreciation of development beyond the school years sheds light on the adult learner and on oneself. How humans develop a sense of self, their personality and their value system all impinge on the individual in the learning situation.

st

Prerequisite: 1  degree in Geography or Undergraduate courses in Social Studies/Geography.

Rationale:

The University of the West Indies

Geography as a school subject in the Commonwealth Caribbean is taught by both Geography and Social Studies teachers. Social Studies teachers, college lecturers and educators have to be equipped with geographical knowledge and skills to advance Geography, particularly, at the lower levels of the Secondary school.  The dearth of geography teachers in schools and the need for training in Geography Education in the teachers' colleges have fostered the need for programmes to train the teacher trainees. Thus the course is designed for teacher educators, education officers responsible for supervision of teachers of geography and other educational practitioners working at various levels of the educational establishment in the discipline of geography. The overall purpose is to assist in fostering a new awakening in geographical ideas and to stimulate a 'renaissance' in geographical education, teaching and learning in the Commonwealth Caribbean.  The course will assist participants to scrutinise their understanding of underpinning theories in geography. It aims to foster and develop the ability to formulate policies. It seeks also to advance Geography as a school subject and as an academic discipline in the Commonwealth Caribbean through research in geography education. It will encourage participants to remedy a shortage of appropriate geography texts for schools by developing skills in evaluating and writing geography text books.

Prerequisite: A first degree in geography, social studies, sociology or any related discipline in education or the social sciences

## Rationale

This course is designed for professionals: teachers, college lecturers and administrators working in the education system of Jamaica and the wider Caribbean. It aims to provide participants with in-depth knowledge, both theoretical and practical, of the urban environment. The study or knowledge of urban places is an important aspect of Geography and Social Studies at both the CSEC and CAPE levels of the Caribbean Examination Council (CXC).   Knowledge of urban places is also important in both the primary and secondary schools' curriculum. Urban places, cities and towns, have greatly but silently influenced social, economic and educational developments of countries. However, not much emphasis is placed on this geographic, spatial and demographic phenomenon.  This course will enable participants to better understand the urban environment.  It also examines the role urban places have had on social life and on the advancement, practice and development of education.

Rationale

The course aims to provide practitioners: administrators, teachers and college lecturers of Geography and/or Social Studies Education with the background of theoretical perspectives   which underpin their respective disciplines and shape social thinking.  Both Geography and Social Studies have borrowed substantially from Social Theory to develop their own theoretical base. The course examines the eclectic nature of both disciplines and expounds on some common areas borrowed from classical as well as contemporary social theory. It particularly considers the upsurge and development of feminist theory in both Geography and Social Studies.

## Rationale

A gap exists in Education for the teaching of Social and Cultural geography at the Higher Education level. Geography at this level in the Caribbean is still steeped in positivism. This course which is designed for teachers, administrators and college lecturers aims to provide a more humanistic approach to the study of geography in a Caribbean context.  It aims to make the study of geography more relevant to the Jamaican/Caribbean social and cultural experiences. It examines areas of social and public concern and

The University of the West Indies explores some of the new directions which have occurred in human geography. It adopts alternative theorisation of culture from one limited to text and artefacts to one more amenable to social life. It addresses sensitive issues, ever present in Jamaican and the wider Caribbean society, such as colour, ethnicity, race, crime, poverty. It examines the cultural in a Caribbean context drawing on the new dimensions of culture developed by Stuart Hall.

## RURAL SETTLEMENTS, SOCIETY   AND EDUCATION

COURSE CODE:   ED 66F

CREDITS:

SEMESTER:

II

DURATION:

39 HOURS - 1 Semester

## Rationale

Rural settlements dominate much of the world despite the increase of the urban population. The majority of the world's population still lives in rural areas with the land and rural life continuing to be important to the culture of the society.  In the developing or Third World much of the world's land is used for agricultural activities. Jamaica and many of   the other countries in the wider Caribbean are essentially rural with agriculture still forming an important part of the economy.  Yet the study of the countryside is one of the neglected areas of social, geographical and educational studies. The course aims to bring the study of the rural   to the fore. It will enable educational practitioners to ponder the importance of rural areas to social, economic and educational development.  It aims to enhance knowledge of the rural both from a contemporary and historical perspective.   Examination is made of the continuity and dominance of the rural.   Although

emphasis is placed on the Caribbean, the course also places rurality in a global context. The course is both theoretical and practical.

## Rationale

Social Studies in a Commonwealth Caribbean context has gone through several changes since its introduction into the educational system in the 1950's. Controversy surrounds its very existence. This course provides a forum for crucial issues to be explored, discussed and debated. The course, by its very nature, reinforces the importance of Social Studies as a school subject as well as an academic discipline in the Commonwealth Caribbean. It advances and develops a platform for Social Studies continuing growth and development in the Commonwealth Caribbean. The course which is designed for educational practitioners: teachers, college lecturers and administrators in Social Studies will provide a base where ideas could be developed and theory and practice explored.  The course will examine new areas of content, methodologies, and resources being incorporated into Social Studies to reflect present day experiences of a global world and the realities of living in the 21 st century. The course will be theoretical, practical and topical.

## Rationale

In the Caribbean context, early childhood professionals at the Masters' degree level frequently work in senior administrative positions providing leaderships in a designated programming area such as managing a day-care centre, training staff or implementing parent programmes.  Leadership responsibilities in the ECD field require a broad base of knowledge and skills to effectively support growth and development of ECD systems.  Such skills might include project or programme development and implementation, monitoring and assessment of personnel and of programmes, budgeting and financial management, training and human resource development, curriculum development, teaching, advocacy, among others.  To hone these skills, the ECD leader must keep abreast of related current issues, trends and developments as these emerge in the fields of early childhood development and leadership.  The purpose of this course is to increase the Masters' degree students' knowledge and understanding  of the critical issues and influences at the local, regional and international levels, that impact their performance as leaders in child development  early childhood programming and implementation and other related areas in the field. Emphasis is placed on new and emerging research

especially from the Caribbean and implications for practice in local and regional contexts.

## PROGRAMME MANAGEMENT

## Rationale

Many of the persons who operate in Early Childhood leadership positions graduate to the position because of experience at the field level - caregiver, teacher, nurse and the like - or because they have received advanced training in one of the technical areas related to Early Childhood Development. They have not been exposed to and, for the most part, have limited, unstructured knowledge of the basic concepts and skills required to function as an effective and efficient programme manager.

This course is intended to introduce them to the range of applicable concepts and skills and to provide an opportunity to apply these concepts and skills to practical solutions.

## Rationale

Recent research has highlighted the importance of child development to social and economic

development of countries. For developing countries, including Caribbean nations, promotion of child development at all levels of society is integral to future development. Promotion of child development requires sound knowledge of theoretical perspectives and the impact that theory, knowledge and practice have made internationally. Promotion of child development in the Caribbean region, however, also requires detailed knowledge of the Caribbean, its culture, its people and their lives and the impact of these on the development of Caribbean children.  This course provides future early childhood leaders with the knowledge and skills required to promote and advocate for child development in the Caribbean region.

Course Rationale and Description

The Master of Education, Leadership in Early Childhood development (MELECD) Programme is one component of a capacity building strategy to strengthen the leadership base of the Early Childhood Development (ECD) sector within the Caribbean region.  The need for leadership and management training for the ECD sector has been established for some time now. How to meet the challenges of making an effective transition from practising educator or caregiver to institutional leadership can no longer be left to individuals called upon to assume positions of leadership.  Increasing attention to the need for effective leadership of the education and day care sectors has converged with

The University of the West Indies growing agreement on the critical importance of the early childhood period in providing the foundation for all subsequent levels of the developmental process.  The convergence of these two trends means that leadership of the Early Childhood Development Sector is an acknowledged priority. This course in interpersonal skills, communication and advocacy in which leaders will be required to mobilize internal and external resources and engage them in the team approach to the management of the sector.

## STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT

## Rationale

Many practitioners in Early Childhood leadership positions have not been exposed to and for the most part have limited knowledge of management principles and practice, especially in the area of strategic management and structured leadership. This area is especially important given that the Early Childhood sector is an emerging sector, whose eventual fate  within the Caribbean socio-economic framework will be determined by the extent to which to which it can be appropriately positioned  in these early years.

Prerequisites:

ED62A Mathematical

Thinking and Learning

Rationale:

The need for new approaches to curriculum and instruction in Mathematics has become increasingly clear over the last tow decades.  The Principles and Standards of School Mathematics (2000) emanating from the United States of America, the United Kingdom's National Curriculum: and South Africa's Curriculum 2005, are but three of the international initiatives which have emphasized more studentcentred and inquiry based learning in Mathematics. In Jamaica, the Revised Primary Curriculum and the Reform of Secondary Education (ROSE) Mathematics Curriculum, Grades 7-9, are also initiatives which demonstrate recognition of the need for change in the way mathematics is both perceived and taught. The impact on society of various technologies, and in particular the calculator and the computer, has also created a need for mathematics curricula to respond so that their benefit to the overall mathematical development of learners is realized.

In the midst of these reforms, the mathematics educator needs to be aware of the forces that shape and guide curriculum reform, be cognizant of the issues which facilitate or impede the school change process with respect to the mathematics curriculum and must also be able to apply those understandings to the process of curriculum selection or adoption and implementation.

## TECHNOLOGY AND THE TEACHING AND LEARNING OF  MATHEMATICS

COURSE CODE:

ED62F

DURATION:

39 Hours

SEMESTER:

Rationale:

The availability of increasingly powerful calculators and the ever increasing influence of and access to computers are providing both challenges and exciting opportunities for mathematics education.  While aids to computation have long been accepted, the power of the calculator raises issues about the skills which are needed by citizens, employees and students at the start of the 21 st century.  The more recent graphical calculator is now an integral part of many A-level programmes and in some countries there are

signs of them being used at the pre-CXC stage. Clarity of thinking about the role of calculators and the implications of their use need to precede the development of clear policies to guide teachers and to inform students, parents and others.

Computers offer many possible contributions for the mathematical education of students.  Primarily they are a tool for exploring mathematics.  With the power to calculate and display which they offer, together with the potential for student control, they can stimulate and challenge thinking.  Computers can be used as a teaching aid and increasingly comprehensive software resources allow students to work with minimal input from teachers.  However, it is too easy to be seduced by the technology without a thorough examination of the implications of the technology for the curriculum, for the students and for the teacher.

Interest in this field throughout the world has generated a considerable amount of development and research.  It is important to consider the issues in a Caribbean context, while benefiting from the experience and lessons learned elsewhere.  It is vital that there are professionals in the region who have relevant skills and who are able to take an informed and critical stance towards developments in this fast changing field.

## Overview

In this course we will explore the relationship between language and learning with the goal of developing teaching practices that involve students with diverse linguistic backgrounds in using language as both a symbolic system and a tool for understanding and construction meaning about a topic of study in a meaningful context.  As well, we will explore how language/literacy may take on different forms and functions in different social contexts or academic disciplines where students engage in reading and writing.  These socially influenced ways of using language (reading, writing, talking) reflect valued ways of knowing within a given academic discipline or school subject.  The kinds of reading and writing activities that the classroom teacher provides the students communicates to them a clear message about the type and quality of thinking that is valued and that they are encouraged to practice.

Our inquiry will provide insight into how to develop supportive instructional practices designed to meet the needs of readers and writers and which will enable students to develop positive identities in connection with reading and writing.

COURSE CODE:  ED64A

CREDITS:             3

DURATION:        39 hours

SEMETER:

1

## Rationale

Prior to the "golden-age" of the worldwide science curriculum reform, which started in the USA and Britain in the late 1950s and continued till the early 1970s, secondary science education in the western world emphasized knowledge acquisition. On the other hand, most of the secondary science curricula developed during this reform period - and up till today - also prioritized conceptual learning of abstract system of scientific knowledge cushioned with laboratory/science process skills.

About the end of the 1960s, there was increasing evidence that many secondary science students had a bad image of science.  Moreover, partly, because of its social, esoteric and academic flavours, many students were not doing well in science and were turning away from the subject.

## The University of the West Indies

In order to make science more relevant to societal needs and encourage more students to study it, attempts have been made since the 1970s to introduce science curricula targeted on social concerns into schools in many parts of the world. The efforts being made have led to a movement towards "science for all" curriculum, a re-emphasis of integration and interdisciplinarity in science teaching, science, technology and society (STS) curricula, as well as a focus on the issues of values in science education.  One of the dominant goals of the STS curricula is the development of critical thinking skills in students to enable them to engage in decisionmaking process in school and out-of-school activities. Despite the lessons learnt from the gaps in the science curriculum reform efforts of the 1960s, there are still recurrent dilemmas amidst the current/new directions in science education.

As in other parts of the world, efforts are being made in the Caribbean to make science education relevant to societal needs. Hence, science teachers in the region - especially the teacher trainers - need to be conversant with and knowledgeable about the major global trends and dilemmas in science education and how these have impacted science curriculum development in the Caribbean.

DURATION:                   39 hours

SEMESTER:

Rationale

Research in recent years has demonstrated the connections between the philosophies of science, learning theories and teaching methodologies.  The central importance of the scientist in the creation of scientific theories has been widely recognized. There has also been an adoption of cognitive perspectives in many educational research programmes concerning learning and the importance of the learner in the teaching of science has been highlighted.

There is now also widespread international interest in the possible uses of the history and philosophy of science in science teaching in order to promote greater appreciation of the nature of science, improve comprehension of science concepts and to demonstrate the cultural and humanistic aspects of science amongst other aims.  Some appreciation of these trends is evidenced by the introduction of aspects of the history of physics in the Caribbean Examinations Council (CXC) physics syllabus (although there is anecdotal evidence that its worth is not accepted by many teachers).

## MEASUREMENT AND ASSESSMENT IN SCIENCE EDUCATION

COURSE CODE:                 ED64C

DURATION: CREDITS:

39 Hours 3

## Rationale

Kempa (1986) points out that examinations and

assessments serve a range of different functions. These may include the: /head2right evaluation of the attainment of students at the end of a course of study /head2right diagnosos of student's learning difficulties

/head2right monitoring student progress, including SBA /head2right estimation of student's aptitudes /head2right selection of students for further education /head2right maintenance of educational standards

Examinations and assessment thus exert a considerable influence on both the content and methodology of the teaching/learning experiences in the classroom.

Regionally the Caribbean Examinations Council has opted for criterion referenced modes of assessment, profiles and a range of examination formats including school based assessment in most subjects.  These examinations are significant as they are used to evaluate students' performance at the end of a course of study and are used for selection to higher education.

More recently, a body of research into the issue of assessment for learning has taken on substantial prominence.  Assessment for learning is now considered to be critical to classroom practice as it focuses on using assessment as a tool for helping students to learn and enabling teachers to more closely monitor students' progress in the classroom. Research in this area points to the fact that significant learning gains can be made by students when the principles of assessment for learning strategies are incorporated into classroom practice.

Science educators in the region need to be aware of the trends of assessment in science education, to understand the bases for reliable and valid assessment and to be able to relate such issues to classroom strategies and methodologies and prepare students for high-stakes examinations.

DURATION:

39 Hours  - 1 SEMESTER

PRE-REQUISITES:  NONE

Description of the Course

This is one of the specialist courses in the M. Ed. Science Education Programme and can be taken as an elective by students in any other M. Ed. Programme since environmental education has crossdisciplinary application.

The course consists of the following themes:

Definitions, history and development of

Environmental Education (EE)

Theory and research in EE

The Jamaican environment

Structure and practice in EE

Teaching and learning in EE

## Rationale for the Course

At a very pragmatic level, the combination of a limited and fragile marine ecosystem, and the heavy resource demand of our main means of livelihood tourism, agriculture, fishing, mining - make it particularly important that the people of the region become committed to the care and protection of the resource base.

The intention of Environmental Education (EE) is to revolutionize the human concept of development

and growth through the cultivation of an ethic that regards the environment as a charge to be cared and protected, even as human beings seek to satisfy their need for food, shelter, clothing, economic and recreational and intellectual advancement.

Fostering such an ethic can only be accomplished through education, since value systems cannot be imposed but have to evolve from within.  This puts a special onus on all teachers, but especially on education administrators and those who have to prepare other teachers for spreading the tenets of environmental education by fostering knowledge, skills, attitudes and values required for environmental responsibility.

Description of Course

This course is designed to get experienced teachers reacquainted with classrooms from new and different perspectives, and to allow them to develop new concepts for examining and understanding classrooms as places for teaching and learning. Participants will discuss these concepts, gaining insight into the teacher's and students' perspectives, the complexities of classroom life, and features of learning oriented classrooms.  The course is organized around three main topics/issues/questions related to teaching and creating learning oriented classroom.  These are:

What meaning does teaching have for teachers? What are some current theoretical perspectives on teaching and learning?

How do we create good classroom environments?

The University of the West Indies

Participants will be expected to draw on and share their experiences of teaching and of being a teacher/teacher educator and to draw on their theoretical knowledge related to teaching, learning and curriculum.   The course draws on various accounts of and theoretical perspectives on teaching, each of which places teaching in a social/cultural and historical perspective.

This is not a course on how to teach, on alternative teaching methods, on learning theories or on principles of teaching, though the origins and effects of all these may form part of the inquiry.  Participants will be expected to draw on and share their experiences of teaching and of being a teacher / teacher educator and to draw on their theoretical knowledge related to teaching, learning and curriculum.  Collaborative learning will be an important part of the course.

The current directions in the demand for education derive primarily from the impact of globalization, of access to the sophistications of an ever-developing technology, and of the call for sustainable development. They require the preparation of educators who can be effective in the less traditional settings of the educational enterprise. Further, the educational enterprise of these times is required to target a wide range of clients.

This course is designed to help participants examine from the perspective of their own context, the current definitions of the newer clients, relevant concepts of learning, and the principles of engaging the learning process and mechanism in the needed development of these newer clients.

Course description:

The Course is described in terms of the answers it explores in the following areas of focus:

- ♦ Clients of the modern educational enterprise - possible definitions, dimensions relevant to the definitions/ descriptions, relevance and implications of cultural differences and variations to the definitions.
- ♦ Process of learning and attendant mechanism - the nature and function of learning and routes in learning.
- ♦ The clients, the process of learning, and the educational enterprise in the context of globalization, technological development, and sustainable development, local, regional and international expressions of these interactions.

## MASTER OF ARTS IN TEACHING (M.A.T.)

STRUCTURE OF PROGRAMME

1.0 Rationale for the Master of Arts in Teaching (M.A.T.)

In the upper levels of the secondary school system as well as in post-secondary, tertiary level and higher education institutions there are many teachers/lecturers who hold first degrees, and in some instances, higher education credentials but have no professional training for teaching. In the non-formal and private education sectors there are also many graduates involved in the training of adults and are desirous of formal training to increase their efficiency and effectiveness in programme delivery.

Designed to suit the varying needs for training in the formal, non-formal and private education sectors, this programme has three tracks.

## TRACK 1

For the training of teachers who will prepare students at the secondary level for CAPE and Advanced level examinations. Often this includes persons who are entering teaching for the first time.

## TRACK 2

For the preparation of teachers in post-secondary institutions, Teachers Colleges and Universities.

## TRACK 3

This caters to persons who are desirous of obtaining a general teaching qualification.  These persons should normally have responsibilities for training in their places.  Candidates must be employed in an institution that will facilitate an internship.

The programme is based on the premise that all teaching and training activities are designed to bring about change and that teachers and trainers should therefore be able to function as effective agents of change empowered with skills for selfevaluation and transformation.

2.0 Qualifications for Admission To be eligible for admissions, applicants must: i.  have a first class or a second class degree (at least lower second or its equivalent)

from an approved university.

OR

have a Diploma or Certificate from an approved university which is deemed to be equivalent to a First degree as in  (i).

Satisfy whatever special Faculty requirements may exist for entry to  certain specialisations and courses.

Candidates with a first degree and a Minor in Education may apply for this programme and may seek exemptions and credit.

## 3.0   Aims

The programme is designed to prepare participants who will be able to:

Prepare students for CSEC, CAPE and Advanced Level examinations in an area of specialisation. Prepare trained teachers for all levels of the school System.

Employ appropriate methodologies for teaching post-secondary and tertiary level students, as well as those in Higher Education.

Deliver general training programmes to suit the needs of a varied clientele.

4.0 Length of programme

The M.A.T. is a flexible delivery programme offered by part time and full time study.

## Full Time

This programme shall normally extend over a minimum of four semesters.

## The University of the West Indies

A full time student shall normally register for not more than sixteen and not less than   twelve credits per semester.

## Part Time

This programme shall normally extend over a minimum of four semesters, and two summers and a maximum of twelve semesters.

A part time student shall normally register for a minimum of six credits and a maximum of nine credits per semester.

The programme in either case begins in June.

The programme is designed so that on successful completion of PART 1, participants who wish to terminate may be awarded a Postgraduate Diploma in Education.  For those who proceed further, successful completion of PART 2 will lead to the award of the Master of Arts in Teaching.

## Candidates may apply for the following:

The MAT Part 1 by full time study.  Candidates are advised to check the  website of the Ministry of Education to see if any scholarships are available.

- ii.       The MAT by full time or part time study.
- iii.       The MAT Part 2 by full time or part time study.  Applicants must already have the Postgraduate Diploma in Education and have satisfied the conditions in 6.1.

## All part time programmes are self-financed.

Candidates must state the track for which they are applying and the area of the specialisation.

## 5.0 Programme Content

The programme normally consists of a minimum of forty six credits and prepares candidates for both general teaching and studies which focus on one area of specialisation with credits distributed as follows:

- A. Theory of Education

- a) A minimum of sixteen (16) credits in the Foundations of Education and Educational Theory, including research methodology;
- b) A minimum of eighteen (18) credits in a professional specialisation or general area.

## MATHEMATICS EDUCATION

Mathematics is a subject which is generally regarded as being very important within the  curriculum  both  for  its  significance  in  gaining  entry  to  employment  and further/higher education and for its use in other school subjects.  Regrettably it is a

## The University of the West Indies

subject  in  which  students  consistently  perform  poorly  in  national  examinations. This is a real challenge for those entering teaching, who are amongst the relatively successful  students  in  the  subject.  A  vision  of  the  subject's  power  and  beauty together with its utility provides a strong starting point for thinking about teaching mathematics  to  students  in  school.    We  shall  look  at  the  ideas  and  practice  of others,  we  will  share  our  thinking  and  experience  and  work  to  develop  our  own understanding of teaching and of course, our skills in the classroom.

with examination results at all levels.  There is a need for dynamic teachers of English who can respond creatively to the challenges of the moment.  This option is for those who either want to embark on a career in English teaching or who, after some teaching experience, are ready  to  reflect  on  what  they  can  further  offer  in  the  classroom.    We  concentrate  on secondary English teaching, which ranges from Grade 7/Form 1 to the CSEC level.  Some of the content which forms the knowledge base of the courses can be used for CAPE teaching.

## LANGUAGE EDUCATION: MODERN FOREIGN LANGUAGES

Contemporary views on modern foreign-language education reflect a focus on the acquisition of language for the purpose of communication , thus overshadowing the once popular traditional approach which emphasized knowledge  about the language.  Fundamentally, a living language, such as the modern foreign language, is perceived  primarily  as  a  means  by  which  persons use the  language  to  exchange ideas and feelings among themselves, thereby opening a gateway to opportunities and activities which  otherwise would  have remained  closed. The growing importance of the foreign language as a means of communication can be linked to the shrinking of the globe through social, economic and political interactions which necessitate competence in more than one's natural language.

The communication goal invites us to examine in our study the nature of language and how it is acquired in its natural setting, to find clues which may assist us in our re-conceptualization and re-formulation of foreign-language classroom teaching and learning.  Foreign-language pedagogy is a very fertile field. It encourages the active contribution of the classroom teacher to its further development through the exploration of the literature, critical thinking, practice and reflection.

The  science  education  component  of  the  Diploma  in  Education  programme  is designed to help teachers to reflect on improving in their classroom practices. There is much evidence to suggest that as we reflect on what we do as science teachers, we  will  become  better  at  teaching  science.    In  this  regard  a  number  of  courses spanning  the  pedagogical  and  the  epistemological  issues  of  science  teaching  are offered.

Internship

Code:

EDTL 5001

Level:

Credits:                 3

This course is flexibly designed to cater to the training needs of students who enter with no teaching experience at all and to those who may have been teaching for several years without formal training.  Depending on the training need, modalities employed will include conducting workshops for trainees, evaluation of a learning intervention developed by the student, to a master teacher/trainee apprentice model involving internship in an educational/training   institution. Participants in Track 1 will be required to be observed over 10-12 weeks in a secondary school and those in tracks 2 and 3 will be observed over the same period in an educational/training institution. In all cases periodic demonstration of teaching ability will be required, so that continuous placement in an institution may not be necessary.

Title:

Enquiry into teaching

Code:

EDTL5002

Level:

Credits:

3

This is an outgrowth  of the internship, and is reflective  in  nature.  It  provides  an  opportunity  for the teacher to reflect on his/her actions, to examine critically strongly held beliefs, assumptions and ideas about  teaching  and  learning  and  to  deliberate  the learners' perspectives on the teaching/learning experience. This process of reflection and self evaluation empowers the teacher to take responsibility  for  improving  his/her  practice  as  well as to enhance theoretical understanding. A variety of ways of representing the experience   is encouraged; for example in the form of a reflective journal, a log or portfolio with video, or a written study.

Title:

Participants will be required to conduct a systematic enquiry into some aspect of teaching which demonstrates knowledge of the literature related to the problem or aspect and an ability to analyse and critically comment on the literature. Action research or an experiment in teaching which includes an assessment of the effectiveness of the method, technique or programme are encouraged, but participants may also do survey research, case studies and evaluation of curricula.  The maximum

length of the Research Project is 18,000 words, (approx. 75 pages).

## POSTGRADUATE DIPLOMA IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION

## Rationale

The current thrust across the Caribbean is to transform the education system and raise achievement at all levels. The upgrading of teachers has been one part of that process.  Another  important  area  in  the  transformation  process  is  the  quality  of leadership  in  schools.  It  requires  attention  to  the  effective  management  and leadership  for  school  improvement.  This  has  bee  confirmed  by  the  Task  Force  in Jamaica (2004) which also identified school improvement  through effective leadership as a major component. The competence of principals, vice principals, and other  types  and  levels  of  administrators  must  therefore  be  upgraded  in  order  to respond to the new needs of the system. In addition, new administrators must be trained in accordance with the requirements of the transformed education system.

The Ministry of Education in Jamaica has requested this programme for training its secondary  school  principals.  Other  Ministries  of  Education  in  the  Caribbean  are seeking a programme like this as a key mechanism to train their principals.

## Overview of Programme

It is designed as an introduction to the world of Educational Administration for those who are embarking on the professional route of school management without the necessary theoretical and practical support. This programme is designed to equip school administrators with the knowledge, skills and dispositions to meet the challenges of the Caribbean, and particularly, the Jamaican education system

## Programme Requirements

The programme requires eight courses of three credits each to include a Practicum and a research project. This diploma allows for easy transfer to the Educational Administration specialisation of the Master of Education.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE PROGRAMME

The  underlying assumption  of  the programme  is  that  the  effectiveness of any organization is dependent on the quality of its management team and that training is essential for quality.

The aims of the programme include the following:

- 1. To enhance the  current thrust to transform the education system in Jamaica, by providing   quality leadership to lead the transformation;
- 2. To  widen  the  vision  and  experience  of  administrators  in  order  that  they  can better understand their management and leadership roles in improving school performance;
- 3. To  provide  a  theoretical  and  philosophical  framework  for  the  practice  of effective administration;
- 4. To develop competencies consistent with participants' administrative roles and acquire knowledge and understanding relevant to the  local, regional and global environment;
- 5. To bring a critical focus to a study of the legal and professional framework of relevant educational systems;
- 6. To provide the opportunity to undertake research relating directly to their own professional working environment.

## Qualifications for Admission

## COURSE DESCRIPTIONS

## EDEA5302: Legal and Professional Competencies for Educational Administration

This course is designed to prepare administrators to act  with  due  consideration  for  the  legal,  regulatory and professional requirements needed to function in the  school  and  education system.    Special  attention will be paid to the code of regulations and cases that have been addressed by different levels of the court system.

## EDEA5313: Leadership for School Improvement

This course is designed to assist principals in developing the skills that relate to effective leadership,  and  to  enable  them  to  participate  in shared  decision-making.    It  should  help  them  to sustain  a  system  of  high  collegiality  and  sharing within their school environment.

## EDEA5311: Human, Financial and Facilities Management

This course is designed to assist principals in developing competencies which relate to placement, induction, mentoring, staff development and appraisal.  It is also intended to enable participants to develop  skills  related  to  the  management  of  school personnel, finance, equipment and facilities.

This course is designed to assist school administrators  in  developing  the  necessary  skills, experience  and  learning opportunities related to understanding and managing behaviour in organisations.    Schools  are  complex  organisations which  function  like  any  private  entity.  It  therefore requires  that  administrators  are  given  the  tools  to manage these organisations in order to achieve both efficiency and effectiveness.

## EDEA5317: Educational Evaluation and Supervision

One of the central functions of the school is to impart to the learner knowledge, skills and attitude that are required for effective living in society.  Evaluation provides feedback regarding teaching and learning, because throughout the teaching process, students are evaluated to find out how well they have attained the objectives of instruction, and teachers are informed concerning how far instructional programmes used have aided in achieving instructional goals.

This course is designed to assist principals in playing the supervisory role through adoption of the collegial model  of  supervision.    It  should  also  help  them  to identify aspects of good supervision and to understand  that  supervision  is  critical  to  leadership and management.

EDEA5305: Action Research in Educational Administration

EDEA5310: Organisational Behaviour in Education

The purpose of the course is to equip students with the competencies to conduct research which is pertinent to solving the immediate problems faced in teaching and learning, administration and other aspects of schooling.

## EDCU5013: Curriculum Theory, Planning and Development

Through the curriculum, educational goals and objectives  can  be  realized  but  this  depends  on  the teachers' interpretations of curriculum and the extent to which they understand and use principles which  guide  curriculum  decision-making.  Teachers have to interpret curriculum guides or CXC syllabuses and  adapt  the national curriculum to suit their unique situations. To be most effective they need the support of their principals. This course is designed to enhance  the  knowledge  of  principals  in  curriculum theory and  planning and  improve  their skills in curriculum  development  with  a  view  to  enabling them to provide the quality of leadership in curriculum   needed to give their teachers a greater sense of empowerment and a more rational approach to teaching.

## EDTK5005:  Integrating Information and Communication Technology in Education

The purpose of the course is to provide students and administrators with the training to acquire ICT skills that will enable them to integrate application tools into teaching and administration.  In addition, the

The University of the West Indies students will be able to use computer skills to manage classroom administrative activities such as frequent communication with students and parents, report writing, calculation of students' grades, analysis of student scores and organisation of teaching. Administrators will be able to apply use of the tools to their planning, accounting and development processes.

## EDPH5005: Issues in Jamaican Education

The  target  group  for  this  course  is  principals  of secondary  schools  and  other  school  administrators. The  course  seeks  to  enable  them  to  explore  issues related to teaching and learning in secondary schools as well as management issues.  These issues cannot be explored from the perspective of a single discipline but requires an inter-disciplinary approach to explore them  fully. Consequently  this course draws  on  educational  philosophy,  psychology  and sociology.  The course is responsive to the fact that social, political, economic  and  other changes in society will give rise to new issues from time to time, and focuses on key issues which have significance for the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  secondary  school principals. It seeks  to  develop  the  participants' understanding  of  the  dynamic  interplay  of  forces

which affect their policies and practices and enables them  to  appreciate  the  critical  role  they  play  in shaping the professional lives of their staff as well as the lives of the citizens of tomorrow.

## EDEA5316: Practicum

The Practicum entails a study of the organization and administration  of  either  an  effective  private  sector organisation or an effective school, in order to obtain ideas, which can be implemented to improve identified aspects of the participants' schools.

## EDEA5319: Study

The purpose of the study is to provide students with an opportunity to conduct research that is pertinent to the education and the school system.  This study may be derived from the practicum or it may be based on any other school-related problem, the study of which is likely to make a difference to the school or classroom situation.  An administrative approach or solution is expected. The students will be able to combine the techniques and methodology learned in the research course with their own experience as educators to conduct the investigation into specific problems faced in the classroom, school and education system.

## Course Description:

## CT60A, B,C: Cultural therapy

The program of Cultural Therapy consists of five broad areas: Ethno historical large group meetings; Centring Exercises; Psychohistoriographic Analysis; Collective poetry, play and musical writing/creation; Evaluation.

## CT61A: Educational Pedagogy

This course is designed to equip students with a basic understanding of the theory behind teaching and learning. Emphasis will be made on the role of education as a tool for social change. Areas emphasized include planning for instruction, instructional strategies and evaluation and assessment of student learning. Classroom management strategies will also be addressed. The technology aspect of the course will include word processing, presentations, record keeping, and computer-aided instruction (CAI).

## CT66A: Rehabilitation Management

Students in this course will examine the practical aspects of nursing, physiotherapy and occupational therapy that relate to Cultural Therapy.  The course explores human movement and its importance in motivation, the detection of signs of medical illness, dealing with elderly, frail or disabled individuals,

behaviour management in rehabilitation, and the assessment and management of daily living and vocational skills.

## CT63A, B, C: Practical Modules

The practical module is designed to expose students to the Visual and Performing Arts, Music and Dance, Floral Arrangement and Crafts as well as other activities deemed appropriate by the course coordinator.  It is expected that students will complete modules outside of their area of expertise in order to broaden their skill base.

## CT64A/B: Supervised Practicum Experience

After their first or second year in the programme students will spend their summer attached to sites where they can receive practical experience in Cultural Therapy and build upon skills developed during the year. Students must be under the supervision of a person working in the field. Students would be required to spend at least 4 days per week at their site. Student's experiences will vary but should include opportunities to strengthen key Cultural Therapy skills, including planning, analysis, writing, organization, record keeping, teamwork, and problem solving. In addition, students will be involved in evaluating the effectiveness of their site by collecting empirical data. The course will bridge the gap between academic coursework and the

practical knowledge, skills and emotional challenges that are inherent in the 'real world' of the 'helping' professional.

## CT65A: Creative Practicum

At the end of their programme students will create and participate in a project designed to create or stimulate wealth in a community setting. Students will design their own work projects, set goals, and work throughout the summer on achieving the preset outcomes. Students will make adjustment to the design of their project when their current contexts indicate it is necessary to do so. Any such allowances will be recorded in the final report, and details of how these adjustments affected the project outcome.

will be presented. Results will be written up and presented to the course coordinator for assessment.

## PS61A: Psychopathology

This course aims to provide students with the knowledge and skills required to accurately diagnose the wide range of mental health problems affecting adults,  adolescents  and  children  in  the  Caribbean. The  course  will  focus  on  the  multi-axial  diagnostic approach  of  the  Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  IV.

The course will begin with a review of the development of the multi-axial approach, cover

## The University of the West Indies

issues  pertaining  to  the  reliability  and  validity  of making  a  diagnosis  and  discuss  the  stigma  of  being diagnosed with a mental illness.  All major diagnostic categories of mental illness will be discussed, including  the  diagnostic  criteria,  associated  features and risk factors.  Special attention will be given to the application and relevance of the diagnostic categories to the Caribbean people.

## PS63A: Clinical Research Skills

This course will commence with an overview of the research process.  The course will progress by walking students through the research process, and the consideration necessary for good research design and results.  Students will throughout the course be exposed to a wide range of statistical analyses that will strengthen their ability to make informed decisions about the tools available to provide the best results in their own research.  Basic statistical concepts, including correlation, regression, and comparison of means, will be covered, as well as more advanced statistical procedures, such as multiple regression, factor analysis, and advanced analysis of variance techniques.

MC666: Effective Communication

List and describe other courses here

The course aims at helping students develop their listening, speaking and writing skills for a variety of workplace situations and professional purposes. Activities centre on planning, organizing, composing, and revising messages with sensitivity to verbal and non-verbal cues.  Documents developed both in class and as home assignments include occupational writing for correspondence letters, memos, e-mail, reports and proposals. Participants will also enhance their skills in public speaking and other forms of oral presentations conveying messages with an emphasis on clear, concise communications.

## PS65A: Issues of Caribbean Psychology: Ethics and Professional Practice Seminar

This  course  will  be  attended  by  all  students  in  the programme and delivered via student led seminars. The  goal  is  to  develop  an  awareness  of  current professional  and  ethical  issues  in  the  practice  of clinical psychology, and to foster an awareness of the specific context of future practice within the Caribbean region.

## Course Description:

## Qualifying ( Pre-Requisite) Courses

## Course OG60A:  An Introduction to Individual  Counselling

This  course  is  designed  to  introduce  participants  to  the  field  of  counselling  by clarifying terminology, examining research findings on the effectiveness of counselling and counsellors, discussing the principles of counselling,  providing an overview  of the counselling process and  relating these to the participants' awareness  of  themselves,  their  motives  and  needs  in  choosing  Counselling  as  a career.      The  course  continues  by  providing  participants  with  an  overview  of  the principal schools of counselling as they emerged chronologically and then provides an in-depth look at counselling skills with particular reference to the counselling of individuals. The limitations of a skills approach to counselling are also explored.  The course ends with an examination of some of the concerns of trainee counsellors as they consider the counselling process and the role of the supervisor.

## Course OG60B: Introduction to Group Counselling

This course begins by discussing the definitions, rationale, goals and types of groups included  in  group  counselling.    Group  leadership  characteristics,  strategies,  skills, functions  and  styles  are  then  explored,  together  with  issues  of  concern  to  group leaders.  The process and practice of group counselling and the nature, roles and behaviour  of  group  members  are  then  analyzed.    The  practical  considerations involved  in  starting  a  group  and  the  kinds  of  communication  activities  which students can use in groups are then described.  Students are taught how to evaluate groups  and  the  module  ends  by  exploring  the  wider  applications  of group counselling.

## Course OG60C: Abnormal Psychology

This course begins by identifying the benefits and pitfalls of psychiatric classifications and how they have been used and misused by counsellors and other

health professionals. Instruments which are used in the assessment and diagnosis of the conditions covered in the course are discussed as each new topic is introduced.. Learning  disabilities  are  then  explored  and  Block  A  ends  with  a  focus  on  mental retardation. Block B begins by looking at  stress and coping and the aetiology, signs, symptoms,  treatment  and  management  of  anxiety  disorders,  mood  disorders, schizophrenia, personality disorders and eating disorders. In Block C the focus shifts to substance abuse with an emphasis on a typology of abused substances, signs and symptoms of substance abuse, treatment, and management. The course ends with a general discussion of the psycho-social impact of these conditions, legal issues and the role of the counsellor. Throughout the course the actual experiences of people who have been challenged  by  these  conditions  are  shared  in  order  to  retain  the emphasis  on  people  rather  than  on    impersonal  and  potentially  destructive psychiatric labels.

## Course OG60D: Developmental Psychology

This course offers an introduction to physical, social, cognitive, moral and linguistic development with an emphasis on theory and methodology. The biological and social bases of behaviour are explored and the pathology associated with failure to achieve psycho-social tasks at each stage is explored.

## Course OG61A:  Person-Centred Counselling

The  course  begins  with  an  introduction  to  Carl  Rogers  and  to  Person-Centred Counselling.  Rogers' original writings are used to develop a thorough understanding of  the  philosophical  base,  the  theoretical  assumptions,  beliefs  and  values  which underlie  Rogerian  Counselling.    Theoretical  perspectives  on  the  acquisition  and maintenance of maladaptive behaviour and on the process of effecting therapeutic personality change  are explored.  Primary emphasis is placed on how to establish a therapeutic relationship and on developing the counsellor's ability to demonstrate the  conditions  which  facilitate  personal  growth.    The  focus  then  shifts  to  PersonCentred  Counselling  in  action  and  to  a  detailed  examination  of  the  counselling process and the development of Person-Centred Counselling Skills. Case studies are

## The University of the West Indies

used  to  develop  insight  into  the  practical  application  of  Counselling  theory.    The course  ends  with  a  detailed  critique  of  Person-Centred  Counselling  in  which research  findings  on  efficacy  are  explored  and  the  wider  applications  of  Personcentred  Counselling  in  families,  groups,  educational  and  other  institutions  are discussed.

## Course  OG61B: Group Counselling: Personal Growth Groups

This course explores the application of Person-Centred Counselling Theory to Group Counselling with specific references to Personal Growth Groups.  The course begins with a description of types of Personal Growth Groups such as T. groups, Encounter Groups, Marathon Groups and Systematic Human Relations Training.  The goals and verbal and non-verbal techniques which are used in such groups are then presented. Leadership,  group  development,  group  dynamics,  communication  and  counselling skills  utilized  in  these  groups  are  then  discussed.    The  course    continues  with practical information on how to organize and evaluate these groups and ends with a discussion  of  the  professional  issues,  ethics  and  criticisms  which  have  to  be considered in using such groups, and wider applications to special populations.

## Course OG61C: Professional Issues Part I

This course is designed as a series of seminars in which various presenters will be initiating  a  discussion  of  professional  issues  which  are  of  concern  to  counsellors. Students are required to attend 80% of the classes on Professional Issues which will be delivered by teleconferencing.  The course begins by examining the ethical, legal and professional development issues which counsellors confront in their practice. Models for ethical reasoning and codes of ethics from various cultures are discussed in order to lay the foundation for the development of a West Indian code of ethics to guide Counsellors in individual and group counselling.   The course then seeks to help  counsellors in training to explore their own reactions to different, and, in some cases,  socially  proscribed  groups  by  looking  at  the  problems  facing  these  groups. The course then ends by looking at the role of the counsellor as a change agent in West Indian societies.

Course OG61D: Existential Counselling

Existentialism is a philosophical approach to counselling rather than a method of counselling.    It has  been  included  in  the  programme  because  it  encourages counsellors to grapple with life and death issues and concerns inherent in human existence  which  clients  often  bring  to  the  counselling  situation.    Accordingly,  this course begins with an introduction to Existential Counselling in which some of the main  assumptions  and  themes  of  this  approach  are  discussed.    The  therapeutic relationship  is  then  highlighted  followed  by  a  detailed  exploration  of  writings  by existential psychotherapists and other existential authors on psychotherapy. Emphasis is given to the practical application of existential philosophy in counselling and to a discussion of the wider applications of this approach.

## Course OG61E: Vocational Counselling

The course begins by reviewing historical information on the introduction of career counselling in West Indian schools. Participants are then introduced to new trends in the job market which have arisen as a result of new technological developments and  economic  changes  sweeping  the  world.  Theories and  research findings pertaining  to  vocational/  career  choice  and  development    are  then  explored. Societal  and  individual    factors  influencing  career  choice  and  development  are analysed.. In the next unit, the world of work, the vocational counselling needs of special groups such as the handicapped are addressed. Block A ends with a unit on how to start and manage a business for those clients seeking to be self-employed. Block  B  focuses  on  the  process  of    finding  and  succeeding  on  the  job.  Detailed treatment  is  given  to  job  hunting  skills,  interpersonal  relationships  on  the  job, financial  planning  and  coping  with  change.  Educational  considerations  are  then explored in Block D not only for the secondary school student selecting subjects in grade nine or third form, but also for the mature student seeking higher education and  for  people  who  need  to  re-enter  the  work  force.    The  course  ends  with guidelines on developing a vocational guidance programme in schools.

Course  OG61F:  Professional Issues Part II

## The University of the West Indies

This course is designed to teach participants how to plan counselling programmes in different organizational settings.  It then discusses the processes and skills involved in Conflict Resolution and Mediation. In Block B, the focus shifts to the development and organization of Counselling Programmes and the course ends with a discussion of issues involved in the  management and delivery of Counselling programmes and services.

## Course OG62A: Psycho-dynamic Counselling with Individuals

This  course examines the psychoanalytic roots of psychodynamic counselling with special  emphasis  on  the  philosophical  assumptions,  the  principal  concepts  and techniques  which  Sigmund  Freud  pioneered  .    Freud's  theories  of  Psycho-sexual development,  his  theories  on  the  development  of  human  personality  and  the functioning of the mind will be analysed.  The work of selected Neo-Freudians will also be discussed as will object relations theory.  The emphasis throughout will be on  the  adaptation  of  long-term  psychoanalysis  to  short-term  psychodynamic counselling. The therapeutic process, the acquisition and maintenance of maladaptive behaviour, the principles and mechanisms of change and psychodynamic  counselling  skills  and  techniques  will  all  be  thoroughly  examined. The wider applicability of psychodynamic counselling to groups and family therapy will also be addressed.

## Course OG62B:  Psycho-dynamic Counselling with Groups

The course examines the application of psycho-dynamic theory to Group Counselling and attendant leadership, membership, communication, group dynamics and professional issues.  Participants will explore in-depth the application of psychoanalytic  techniques  to  group  counselling.    The  course  ends  with  a discussion  of  criticisms  and  research  findings  on  the  effectiveness  of  psychodynamic  group  counselling  and  its  application  to  special  groups,  as  well  as  the contribution  which  Psycho-dynamic  Group  Counselling  can  make  to  Eclectic  and Integrative Approaches to Counselling.

## Course  OG62C: Research Methods Part I: Quantitative Research Methods

This  course  examines  the  steps  and  skills  involved  in  conducting  quantitative research.  The course begins by exploring the nature of enquiry, and then describes how to select and construct hypotheses, how to review the literature, identify and label variables and construct operational definitions of these variables.  Techniques for the manipulation and control of variables and problems of validity and invalidity are then explored.  The course continues by teaching participants how to construct research designs, engage in proper procedures for observation and measurement, construct  and  use  questionnaires  and  interview  schedules    and  utilize  sampling procedures and statistical tests.  Parametric and non-parametric statistical tests are discussed.    The  course  ends  by  teaching  participants  how  to  use  data  processing procedures and write a research report.

## Course OG62D: Cognitive-Behavioural Counselling with Individuals

This course explores the interaction between thought, perception, emotions and the many factors which shape behaviour.  It begins with an overview of the cognitivebehavioural  school  of  counselling    and  then  focuses  in  depth  on  cognitivebehavioural  theory  and  the  practical  counselling  skills  and  techniques  which  are used to help individual clients learn new patterns of behaviour.  The course ends with a critique of this approach and the wider applications of this model to groups, families and educational institutions.

## Course OG62E: Cognitive Behavioural Group Counselling

This  course  discusses  the  application  of  cognitive  behavioural  theory  to  group counselling.    It  begins  with  problem  identification  and  goal  setting  and  then continues by examining how to organize cognitive behavioural group counselling in terms of logistics, content, sequence, methods, leadership, membership, activities, group dynamics and process issues, monitoring, evaluation, termination and followup.  The course ends with a critique of cognitive behavioural group counselling and a discussion of the  wider applications of the theory with specific reference to Family therapy,  and  a  detailed  treatment  of  the  place  of  Cognitive  Behavioural  Group Counselling Theory and Practice in Eclectic and Integrative Approaches to

The University of the West Indies Counselling.

## Course OG62F: Developing an Eclectic / Integrative Approach to Counselling

This course seeks to help the student to consider the integrative themes underlying all of the major schools of counselling included in this M.Sc programme as a prelude to developing the student's own personal theory of counselling. The course begins by considering the extent to which it is possible to reconcile conflicting philosophical assumptions,  beliefs  and  values  as  expressed  in  the  Psycho-dynamic,  Humanistic and Cognitive- Behavioural schools of counselling. It then encourages the student to consider  the  implications  of  these  schools  of  thought  for  his  or  her  own  selfdevelopment,  self-exploration  and  self-knowledge.  It  then  systematically  explores the extent to which these counselling theories can be integrated in an effort to help counsellors to understand their clients' concerns and to improve their  professional practice. The course ends with  each student thinking through and  writing down his or  her  own  personal  theory  of  counselling  to  guide  his  or  her  own  counselling practice.

## Course OG62G:  Family Therapy

This is an introductory course on theoretical and therapeutic components of major schools of therapy concerning marital and family therapy.  Videotapes, training films and simulations will be used to explore therapeutic behaviours which differentiate schools of therapy.  There will be an emphasis on perceptual, conceptual and clinical skills of family therapists.  This course  provides a foundation for future training in this area.

## Course OG62H: Research Methods Part II: Qualitative Research Methods

This course focuses on the nature, principles, theories and methods of qualitative research. It begins by discussing the nature of knowledge and qualitative research as well as theories and principles guiding this kind of research.  Different approaches and  methods  are  examined  including  action  research,  case  studies,  ethnographic

research,  discourse  analysis  and  comparative  methodologies.    Participants  are taught how to use data gathering techniques and how to analyze and write research reports using qualitative research methods.

## Course OG62 I: Cognitive-Behavioural Counselling with Individuals Part II

This  course  builds  on  Course  OG62D  by  discussing  how  to  select  and  implement strategies  to  use  in  Cognitive-Behavioural  Counselling  of  individuals.    Additional strategies  are  also  described,  including,  symbolic  modelling,  using  oneself  as  a model and participant modelling, emotive imagery and covert modelling, cognitive modelling  and  problem  solving,  cognitive  restructuring,  re-framing  and  stress inoculation,  meditation,  muscle  relaxation,  systematic  desensitization  and  selfmanagement strategies.  Issues relating to termination and follow-up are explored, and the course ends by presenting a range of criticisms of the wider applications of this approach to counselling.

## Course OG63A: Tutorials on the Research Project

These sessions have been designed as tutorials whose purpose is to assist students on a weekly basis via teleconferencing, as they work on their research projects.  The presenters  will  act  as    resource  persons  and  the  tutorials  will  be  developed  and directed  by students  to meet their  own needs for supervision as they design and conduct research and write their projects.

## The Research Proposal

The University of the West Indies Course Description:

NE60A The course exposes postgraduate students to advanced and current practices in caring for children and adolescents during specific the growth development episodes along the life cycle.

Students gain beginning prescriptive skills, proficiency in using the nursing process and documentation system through three (3) days weekly direct preceptored interaction with clients/patients and their families and to be enabled to practice at an advanced nursing level.  Students are preceptored 1:1 practicum provides ongoing guidance and assessment of clinical practice focusing on caring, critical thinking, clinical judgment, problem solving and documentation.

NE60B - The student for four (4) days weekly engages in a more extensive continuation of Practicum 1 with more independent and less closely monitored preceptorship and assessments.  The student increasingly undertakes responsibility for a client/patient load on a daily basis.

NE60C This course enables students to synthesize evidence-based knowledge and learning from previous nursing courses into practice. The student consolidates his or her practice experiences through independent and interdependent practice under preceptorship in the prospective working environment (or as near as possible) with regular

ongoing monitoring, supervision and guidance.  This practicum concludes with a one (1) week review by the preceptor where the student is engaged in oral and written presentations, self and programme evaluation and exit interview

NE60D This course exposes students to concepts, scientific bases and theoretical constructs that underpin clinical nurse specialization; explores current issues related to advanced nursing practice; differentiates among advanced nursing practices; and assist in linking organizational instruments to clinical nursing operations.

## EC61A &amp; EC61B/ Microeconomic Theory I&amp;II

## Course Description:

This  two  course  sequence  is  a  survey  of  microeconomic  principles,  problems  and applications,  with  most  of  the  emphasis  on  principles.  The  course  will  assume familiarity  with  linear  algebra  and  calculus  and  will  sometimes  make  use  of  more advanced mathematical tool. Microeconomic Theory I presents the general equilibrium and partial equilibrium models of price formation under conditions of perfect  competition.  In  doing  so,  there  are  in-depth  analyses  of  the  theory  of consumer  under  certainty  and  the  theory  of  the  perfectly  competitive  firm. Microeconomic  Theory  II  explores  the  formation  of  prices  under  conditions  of imperfect competition. In  doing so, there is in-depth analysis of consumer choice under uncertainty, the behaviour of firms under various assumptions of imperfect competition, and the formation of prices in the presence of externalities.

## EC62A &amp; EC62B/ Macroeconomic Theory I&amp;II

## Course Description:

The  purpose  of  these  courses  is  to  introduce  the  student  to  the  analysis  of macroeconomic issues at a more advanced level. The emphasis in the first semester course is on becoming familiar with the techniques and basic models of analysis that macroeconomists  use.  Students  will  explore  models  that  uncover  fundamental relationships and are suitable for analysis of economic fluctuations -the representative agent and overlapping generations' model. Also, time will be spent reviewing the mathematical prerequisites necessary to manipulate the models you will encounter later in the course. In the second semester course, the objective is to cover the various approaches to explaining to the phenomena of economic growth. At the end of the sequence, the student will have an understanding of why and how

economies experience cyclical swings and grow over time, as well as have the basic tools to work through published economic literature in order to deepen and extend his  or  her  understanding  in  these  and  other  areas.  Essentially,  students  will  be exposed to a smaller number of topics, but in rather great depth than in the first course.

## EC63A &amp; EC63B/ Economic Development I&amp;II

## GT62B/ Selected Issues in International Law

## Course Description:

This  course  examines  the  extent  to  which  Public International  Law  contributes  to  international  order and  development  in  a  number  of  contexts.  It  is concerned with the ways in which Public International  Law  has  influenced  approaches  to  the Use of Force, foreign investment, and the promotion and protection of human rights. Special emphasis will be placed on the role of international organisation in the  formulation  of  legal  regimes  for  international order and in fostering international development. At the same time, attention will also be focused on the precise  operation  of  legal  rule  at  the  international level.

## GT62G/ The World Trading System

Course Description:

The course will first examine the legal institutional/constitutional structure of the WTO. This will be followed by an examination of the basic theory  of  trade  liberalisation,  and  the  related  core obligations of the two most important WTO Agreements regulating trade in goods and services the GATT and GATS respectively. The main objectives of  this  course  are  to  demonstrate an understanding of  the  constitutional/philosophical  underpinnings  of the international system of international trade regulations; identify/outline the main rules/principles of  the  system;  determine  the  extent  to  which  the system is representative of the interests of developing  countries;  understand  the  relevance  of WTO; understand the relevance of WTO -compatability re: the relationship between regional/preferential trade arrangements  and  the WTO; appreciate the relationship between globalisation and the movement towards the inclusion  of  new/emerging  issues  (especially  labour and the environment) and their significance  for  the continued  participation  of  developing  countries  in the system and demonstrate an understanding of the fundamentals of the dispute settlement.

## GT62K/ International Economic Law

## Course Description:

This course emphasises  the  importance  of  legal prescription/regulations in achieving 'global

The University of the West Indies

economic  coherence'.  It  will  focus  primarily  on  the operations and influence of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the World Trade Organization, as the principal international organizations  responsible  for  the  determination  of legal regimes governing the achievement of economic liberalization and development. Throughout, the role of politics and the influence of the more powerful (State and Private) players in the prescription of appropriate economic  policies to correct structural imbalances  will be  highlighted. However, the course focuses on the increasing reference  to  the  legality  of  state  conduct  and  the importance  of  monitoring  and  compliance  as  two distinct legal outcomes with implications for developing countries. It considers the role of law  in the governance of the international economic order, and  the  possible  legal  recourse  (if  any)  open  to recipient state - both of which will be analysed in the wider  context  of  the  need  for  reform  of  existing structures and processes of these institutions.

## GT62C/ The Politics and Law of the Sea

## Course Description:

This  course  will  examine  the  rules  of  international law pertaining to the sea. Emphasis will be placed on the  development of  the  law  of  the  sea  in  the  post-

World  War  II  period,  and,  in  particular  on  the  new rules on the law of the sea which have emerged out of negotiations at the first and  second  Geneva Conference  on  Law  of  the  Sea.  Although  attention will be paid to technical rules in areas such as access to natural resources and navigational rights for States,  the  focus  will  be  placed  on  the  different political and economic  interests which underpin current  rules  and  principles.  The  course  will  also examine the interplay between issues of development, hegemony, geography and geopolitics in  the  evolution  of  the  prevailing  legal  rules.  The relationship  between  the  various  Law  of  the  Sea treaties and customary international law shall also be emphasised.

## GT62L/ International Trade and the Environment

## Course Description:

This  course  provides  a  systematic  analysis  of  the factors  informing  the  inclusion  of  this  matter  in  the WTO trade negotiating process. While much emphasis  will  be  placed  on  the  WTO,  the  course includes a comparative examination/analysis of NAFTA, EU, the FTAA and international law principles, as well as reference to economic and political considerations related to the topic. It seeks to examine, in detail, the role of environmental concerns in the formulation of trade policy initiatives/measures,  the  issue  of  extraterritoriality,

implications  for  the  sustainability  of  the  WTO  as  an international regulatory institution and more importantly, the possible legal and policy implications of this for the market access opportunities of developing countries.

## EC61B / Microeconomic Theory II

## Course Description:

## GT60A:  Leading Issues in Public Management

This course aims to deepen students' theoretical and empirical knowledge about public management. Emphasis  is  placed  on  developing  students'  critical appreciation of rival analytical approaches about the nature and functioning of public management, drawing  on  national  and  international  perspectives and on their ability to apply this understanding to the contemporary public management context.

## GT60B Leading Issues in Development Management :

This course provides students with an in-depth understanding of development issues from a public management perspective. Using the development management  analytic framework as its primary anchor, the course emphasises as well as exposes students to discourses concerned with: the development administration/development management nexus; (re) conceptualisation of the state and state capacity; institutional analysis of development management and theories and empirics of development and understanding.  Simultaneously students are directed to engage analytically with the international context of development theory and practice particularly the role of international technical bureaucracies as 'policy advocates'.

GT61A:  Emergence of State-Owned Enterprises

This course aims to introduce students to the analysis of some  of  the  recurrent  issues  in state-owned enterprise performance.  The scope of the course is both international and interdisciplinary, and students will confront a wide range of literature documenting experiences across a number  of  developed  and developing  countries,  with  particular  emphasis  on political science, legal and institutional and economic perspectives.  Much of the focus of the course will be conceptual and theoretical. Students will be expected to analyse and discuss various problems in the  context  of  the  various  conceptual  frameworks with which they will become familiar.

## GT61E:  Regulation and Regulatory Reform

This  course  aims  to  introduce  students  to  the academic  study  of  public  policy  towards  the utilities and financial sectors in a postprivatisation  era.    For  most  of  the  topics  to  be examined, this course adopts a comparative perspective,  and  will  draw  on  evidence  from  a number  of  countries,  although  emphasis  will  be placed  on  developments  in  Jamaica,  the  United Kingdom  and  North  America.    The  approach taken to the case studies examined is selfconsciously interdisciplinary, and students will be required to handle sources drawn from a range of disciplines drawn from political science, law, and institutional economics.  Much of the focus of the course will be conceptual and theoretical, but the

students  will  be  expected  to  apply  the  relevant concepts and theories to the different cases examined during the course.

## GT62A:  Theories and Issues in Contemporary International Relations

This course engages students in a detailed survey of the principal theories and approaches to International Relations and the prevailing theoretical debates  in  the  field  at  the  beginning  of  the  21st century.    It  also  encourages  students  to  critically evaluate  International  Relations  theories  from  the perspective of developing states and their peoples, to question the extent to which these theories focus on development issues and the positions of developing countries in the international system.

## GT62B: Selected issues in International Law

This  course  examines  the  extent  to  which  Public International  Law  contributes  to  international  order and  development  in  a  number  of  contexts.    It  is concerned with the ways in which Public International  Law  has  influenced  approaches  to  the Use of Force, foreign investment, and the promotion and  protection  of  human  rights.    Special  emphasis will be placed on the role of international organizations in the formulation of legal regimes for

international  order  and  in  fostering international development.  At the same time, attention will also be focused on the precise operation of legal rules at the international level.

## GT62C:  The Politics and Law of the Sea

This  course  will  examine  the  rules  of  international law pertaining to the sea.  Emphasis will be placed on the  development of  the  law  of  the  sea  in  the  postWorld  War  II  period,  and,  in  particular  on  the  new rules on the law of the sea which have emerged out of negotiations at the first and  second  Geneva Conferences  on  the  Law  of  the  Sea  and  the  Third United  Nations  Conference  on  the  Law  of  the  Sea. Although attention will be paid to technical rules  in areas such as access to natural resources and navigational rights for States, the focus will be placed on  the  different  political  and  economic  interests which  underpin  current  rules  and  principles.    The course will also examine the interplay between issues of development, hegemony, geography and geopolitics  in  the  evolution  of  the  prevailing  legal rules.    The  relationship  between  the various  Law  of the  Sea  treaties  and  customary  international  law shall also be emphasized.

GT62E: Government and Politics of Selected Regions:  Latin America

The  general  focus  of  this  course  is  on  the  political development and the international relations of Latin America.  However, this is a large and complex area and we are obliged to be selective in our coverage. Each year, therefore, after a general introduction to the comparative Politics of Latin America, the focus is on  a  specific  sub  region,  like  Southern  Cone  or  the Andean  region.    The  subject  headings  and  readings provide  a  basic  introduction  to  the  history,  political and  institutional  development  of  these  countries, their regional and international relations.  In addition to  gaining  a  deeper  knowledge  of  a  part  of  Latin America, one of the main objectives of the course is to  better  appreciate  where  the  Caribbean  fits  into this wider region, and to analyse the forces of change which are shaping new directions in Caribbean-Latin American relationships.

## GT62G:  The World Trading System

The course will first examine the legal institutional/constitutional structure of the WTO. This will be followed by an examination of the basic theory of trade liberalisation, and the related core obligations of the two most important WTO Agreements regulating trade in goods and services the GATT and GATS, respectively.  The main objectives of this course are to demonstrate an understanding of the constitutional/philosophical

underpinnings of the international system of international trade regulations; identify/outline the main rules/principles of the system; determine the extent to which the system is representative of the interests of developing countries; understand the relevance of WTO; understand the relevance of WTO-compatibility re: the relationship between regional/preferential trade arrangements and the WTO; appreciate the relationship between globalisation and the movement towards the inclusion of new/emerging issues (especially labour and the environment) and their significance for the continued participation of developing countries in the system and demonstrate an understanding of the fundamentals of the dispute settlement.

## GT62H:  Regionalism in a Globalized Age

This  course  will  explore  the  several  dimensions  of regionalism in the current era of economic globalization  and  compare  the  evolution  of  regional cooperation in a number of studies. The case studies will be the European Union, The Common Market of the Southern Cone  (MERCOSUR)  and  the  North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA).

## GT62J: International Political Economy

This course will introduce students to the main theories of political economy, with particular reference to their role in international relations

The University of the West Indies

theory.  It will also take these theories into consideration in studies of various issues in contemporary international political economy.

## GT62K: International Economic Law

This course emphasises the importance of legal prescription/regulations in achieving 'global economic coherence'.  It will focus primarily on the operations and influence of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the World Trade Organization, as the principal international organizations responsible for the determination of legal regimes governing the achievement of economic liberalization and development. Throughout, the role of politics and the influence of the more powerful (State and Private) players in the prescription of appropriate economic policies to correct structural imbalances will be highlighted. However, the course focuses on the increasing reference to the legality of state conduct and the importance of monitoring and compliance as two distinct legal outcomes with implications for developing countries.  It considers the role of law in the governance of the international economic order, and the possible legal recourse (if any) open to recipient state - both of which will be analysed in the wider context of the need for reform of existing structures and processes of these institutions.

## GT62L: International Trade &amp; The Environment

This course provides a systematic analysis of the factors informing the inclusion of this matter in the WTO trade negotiating process.  While much emphasis will be placed on the WTO, the course includes a comparative examination/analysis of NAFTA, EU, the FTAA and international law principles, as well as reference to economic and political considerations related to the topic.  It seeks to examine, in detail, the role of environmental concerns in the formulation of trade policy initiatives/measures, the issue of extraterritoriality, implications for the sustainability of the WTO as an international regulatory institution and more importantly, the possible legal and policy implications of this for the market access opportunities of developing countries.

## GT63A: Caribbean Political Systems 1

Caribbean political systems face new strains brought on by the crises of climate change, energy and food, on  top  of  not  so  new  ones  like  crime  and  violence, HIV/AIDS,  and  deeper  structural  ones  like  poverty and inequality, all related to the nature of Caribbean societies and globalization. These strains pose threats to  development,  stability,  democracy,  human  rights

and nation building. This course studies the possible responses  of  and  to  Caribbean  political  systems  in the face of these crises. Its main question is this: Are Caribbean political systems built for crisis management in states that are highly vulnerable and prone to crisis? It begins with a critical analysis of the concept of governance in the Caribbean context. The concept is  applied  to  different  political  systems  like those  of  Haiti,  Cuba,  Guyana,  Trinidad  and  Tobago, and Jamaica. We try to understand it's relevance to failed or fragile states (like Haiti) and small, vulnerable  and  dependent  post-colonial  Caribbean states generally. The course also addresses this question  at  the  regional  level  of  CARICOM  and  the OECS.

## GT63B: Caribbean Political Systems II

This course brings together new thinking about human rights (the Rights-Based Approach), democracy (as empowerment), and development (as equity). All of these come together to support the 'right to development'. This right to development (UN, 1986) is now challenged by what the United Nations agrees is a 'development emergency' (2008). It analyzes Caribbean political systems in terms of their structural capacity to provide a right to development. It considers it necessary to think about Caribbean political systems in terms of a new paradigm of democracy and development where democracy is more developmental and development is more democratic. At the same time, political

The University of the West Indies

structures must have the capacity to respond to a situation where failures of human rights, empowerment, and equity constitute a development emergency.

## GT64A: Democracy 1

This course investigates a paradox of the democratic experience - democracy is the most preferred system of politics in the world and yet people are more dissatisfied with democracy than at any other time. It considers the discontent with democracy and how in fact to further democratize democracy. It begins by surveying the evidence for the paradox. It then explores various perspectives that democracy confronts, such as the structure of power in society, conflicts over rights and national identity, immigration and national integration, culture and multiculturalism, executive, legislative and electoral arrangements, security, corruption, inequality, and globalization. Each of these represents an aspect of the democratic paradox. The presumption is that equity and inclusion are important ingredients if democracy is to be developmental and citizens are to be more contented with democracy.

## GT64B:Democracy 11

This course studies popular attitudes towards democracy in five Caribbean countries - Jamaica, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Guyana and Belize as

expressed in surveys of the Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP). The rationale is to understand how Caribbean people feel about their democracy. We will try to identify areas of satisfaction and dissatisfaction. In so doing, we wish to understand what people believe democracy to be and should be. We consider whether Caribbean societies need remedy, renewal or transformation. We begin by studying how people come to the beliefs they have about democracy and social reality in general. As such we try to understand the basis for the apparent paradox of democracy in the Caribbean, one where people have positive beliefs about democracy as a set of principles but appear dissatisfied with democracy in practice.

## GT65A: Political Theory

This course has a strong focus on the Caribbean and engages  recent  writing  that  explores  its  intellectual traditions and current debates. It introduces students to debates about Caribbean thought, philosophy and theory and highlights the implications of the transatlantic slave trade for political theorizing, discusses theories of decolonization and postcolonialism. It takes the discussion from that era into the 21 st century. It looks not only at current theoretical debates but begins an important dialogue about Caribbean Futures. This  course  also  discusses key  issues  in  global  political  thought,  the  impact  of modernity and western political thought, the

environment, the emergence of countervailing movements  such  as  those critical of neo-liberal globalization and movements such as those based on Islamic  jihad.    Your  reading  has  to  be  careful  and analytical, paying attention to definitions and argumentation. This is not ordinary narrative reading. It is the search for the theoretical premises on which arguments are based and the methodological strategies deployed.

## GT65B: Political Theory -Radical and Critical Theories in Modern Political Thought

This course reads and analyses six volumes of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission Report.  However,  the  focus  in  the  TRC  on  truth  in politics, on issues of reconciliation and justice remains critical not only in relation to a white/black situation,  but  the  ethnic  violence  after  the  2007 Kenyan elections and the genocide in Rwanda indicate how easy it is for political elites to manipulate  inter-ethnic  African  conflicts.  The  TRC may  become  more  important  for  relations  among Africans as a basis for compromise and negotiations instead of war and bloodletting.

The TRC Report inductively forces us to think deeply about matters pertaining to the state, justice, equality, liberty, freedom, trust, revolutions and revolutionary situations, symbolic manipulations, diplomacy and war among others.  And in the more

modern and supposedly pragmatic version of political thought, the TRC work stimulates conceptual formation  and  review  in areas such as political culture,  political  mobilization,  political  integration, political  distribution  and  overall  sustainable  political development.

## GT66A:  Quantitative  Research  Methods  in  Social

## Sciences

This course is a weekly seminar in research methods with emphasis on bivariate and multivariate techniques  for  analysing  quantitative  social  science data.    The  seminar  is  intended  to  help  graduate students  develop  a  sophisticated  understanding  of the conceptual foundations of research design, measurement  strategies,  and  bivariate/multivariate statistical Analysis of data in the social policy sciences. Primary emphasis will be placed on developing  an  understanding  of  the  logic  of  inquiry and  appropriate  research  strategies  rather  than  on extensive manipulation on mathematical formulas.  A basis  competence  in  algebra  should  be  sufficient  to grasp  the  mathematical  aspects  of  the  course.  The theoretical sophistication, research skills, and statistical knowledge acquired from this should enable  the  student  to  better  comprehend  technical literatures in professional journals and will help with basic tools with which to design and execute research projects.

## GT66B:  Qualitative Research Methods

A  complement  to  GT66A,  this  course  provides training in philosophies and methods of qualitative  inquiry  in  the  social  sciences,  with particular emphasis on techniques employed by political scientists in studying the historical, cultural, textual, subjective, symbolic, meditated, propagandistic, and rhetorical aspects of political life. Weekly  lectures,  student  projects,  lab  exercise  in computerized  text/content  analysis,  and assigned reading  are  used  to  explore  the  major  theoretical paradigms of qualitative political research, and common  methods  for  collecting  and  interpreting qualitative materials.

## GT66C: Analysis of Political Opinion and Media

This course examines the major theories and methods applied by political scientists in studying public opinion and mass media. It focuses on the communicative, symbolic and subjective aspects of human interaction in politics, with particular attention to issues that lie at the intersection of public opinion, electronic and print media, and democratic governance. A broadly interdisciplinary perspective is taken, drawing from politicallyrelevant theories and empirical research techniques in the adjacent disciplines of communication, linguistics, public relations, consumer marketing, sociology, psychology and anthropology. The course

is particularly recommended for students who are considering politically-oriented careers related to public relations, public opinion polling, marketing research, political consulting, campaign management, and television and newspaper journalism.

## GT66G: Methods &amp; Models of Transitional Justice

This course is intended to be a critical examination of the recently flourishing sub-field of transitional justice. Transitional justice is the conception of justice primarily concerned with developing ways of dealing with perpetrators as well as victims of a previous authoritarian regime. In effect it is how a society responds to prior injustice and human rights violations in a way that seeks not to repeat them. This course will therefore examine the meanings, nature, causes and approaches to transitional justice. It will be primarily concerned with the mechanisms of human rights regimes and the role of truth commissions, reparations and restitution in transitional justice.

The course will be primarily an examination of some of  the  societies  who  have  made the transition from authoritarian rule and towards democracy. The countries  will  be  drawn  from  Latin  America,  Africa and Europe. The major cases to be examined will be Argentina,  Chile,  Rwanda,  South  Africa,  and  Eastern Europe.  As  a  major  requirement  of  this  course,

The University of the West Indies

students  will  have  to  design  a  transitional  country model.

## GT66T: Principles and Practices of Egovernance

Information and communication technologies (ICTs) have transformed the landscape and process of democratic governance in many parts of the world. In the Caribbean for example, this is evident by the migration of many government services to the internet as well as the several modernization exercises which have been undertaken in the last decade to make government agencies more efficient, transparent, accountable and, responsive to the needs of civil society. The need thus arises to develop the capacities of public sector workers (or those interested in understanding and/or researching electronic governance - egovernance) across the region to be able to (1) effectively develop appropriate egovernance models and/or (2) understand the dynamics, components and dimensions of egovernance as well as to (3) effectively evaluate this phenomenon. There is however a disconnect between the world of democratic governance and ICT. This course attempts to bridge that divide by providing students with the knowledge to bridge this gap.

## GT67A: Politics in the Middle East

This course is designed to deepen students' knowledge of Middle Eastern societies and to explore how  the theories and methods of comparative politics  help  us  to  make  sense  of  social,  economic and  political  processes  in  the  contemporary  Middle East.  In additional, it is intended to explore what the Middle East can tell us about theories and methods in  comparative  politics,  political  economy,  political sociology  and/or  international  relations.    The  intent of the seminar is not only to explore the various and complex  dynamics  of  Middle  Eastern  societies  but also to connect political science issues in the Middle East  with  broader  theoretical  concerns  and  debates in the social sciences.

With these aims in mind, our discussions and readings will focus not only on phenomena that need to be explained, but on the kinds of theories that are used to explain them and how the two interact in the study of the Middle East.  The course will focus on the 20 th and 21 st centuries, with particular attention to the period since the Second World War.  The course will study the political processes of Middle Eastern states over time, and also their relations with one another, as well as with states outside the region.  We will also be comparing what we know about the Middle East with what leading theories of comparative politics or political economy tell us the Middle East should be like.   For instance, we will examine the literature dealing with state formation

and state crisis, legitimacy, stability, and authoritarianism, leadership, elites, ideologies, collective action.  We will also discuss current research issues, including religious or ethnic conflicts, political consequences of structural adjustment, liberalization, democratization, civil society, and gender issues.

## GT68A: United States Foreign Policy

The United States today is inarguably the world's sole superpower, yet little over a century ago the US was just a bit player in the international political and economic arena. The US is also the most important actor in Caribbean international relations today, by a number of different measures. This course examines the causes and consequences of American foreign policy since 1776, with specific reference to the Caribbean.

## Additional Information/Notes:

## MSc. (Public Sector Management) Research Paper

## MGMT6125: International Hospitality Business

This purpose of this course is to familiarize students with the globally applicable theories of international business in the context of the practice of management  in  a  small  open  developing  country environment, while also focusing on the key challenges  confronting  government  policy  makers and firm managers who are seeking to improve the competitiveness of the tourism and hospitality sectors  over  which  they  have  responsibility,  or  the firms that they manage. The course builds upon the

unassailable conclusion that the development  of countries in the Caribbean region will rest upon the ability of firms within the region to engage profitably in international business activities.

## MGMT6126: Sustainable Tourism Management

This course will introduce the principles of sustainable development, provide an understanding of the social, economic and environmental issues that will determine the future of tourism in the Caribbean, and impart  the  skills  needed  to  develop  and  manage  the industry  on  a  more  sustainable  basis  in  the  years ahead. The course will introduce students to methods for planning, developing, financing and managing tourism  products  within  a  framework  of  sustainable development, including attraction management, marketing and specialist operations such as ecotourism.

## MGMT6128: Decision Making Under Uncertainty

Decision Making Under Uncertainty is designed to  address  the  application  of  decision  theory  to the quantitative analysis of risky decision problems.    Risky  decision  problems  generally involve large amounts of resources that must be committed  to alternatives in competitive and uncertain environments. Examples would include corporate acquisition decisions, new product decisions, major capital investment decisions,  choices  among  alternate  technologies,

and choices among alternate destinations.  Many of  these  problems  can  be  conceptualized  and structured using the ideas of decision theory.  The course therefore provides a structured framework within which the decision maker can make logical and rational decisions, using various decision-making tools. These tools include Linear Programming, Probability Models, Decision  Tree,  Utility,  Influence  Diagram,  and Monte Carlo Simulation.

## MGMT6129: Tourism Management

The course focuses  on  approaches  to  and  trends  in destination marketing,  a practical framework  for strategic  destination  marketing/branding,  analyzing and interpreting the macro, market and competitive environments,  undertaking  a  destination  attractions and resource analysis, market segmentation and the selection of target markets, destination branding and competitive positioning, developing and implementing integrated marketing and communication strategies, facilitating destination marketing partnerships, benchmarking and evaluating destination marketing strategies, and managing information and marketing research. International  "best  practices",  relevant  case  studies and practical guidelines form an integral part of the course.

MGMT6130: Food &amp; Beverage Management

Students  who  take  the  course  will  be  exposed  to ways  in  which  food  and  beverage  outlets  may  be both  a  source  of  profit  and  competitive  advantage for the organization.  They will also be exposed to the most common pitfalls in successfully operating such outlets  and  should  gain  an  understanding  of  why some  organizations  have  chosen  to  outsource  their food and beverage management outlets.

## MGMT6131: Property Management

This  course  is  designed  to  introduce  you  to  the general  principles  of  managing  the  non  food  and beverage  concerns  of  tourism  properties.    Rather than  focusing  on  the  nuts  and  bolts  of  day  to  day management  the  course  will  focus  on  the  strategic aspects  of  property  management.

## MGMT6133: Events Planning &amp; Management

The importance of the events industry lies in its ability to create employment  and  income,  to increase foreign exchange earnings and stimulate business activity within host destinations. In addition,  it  helps  promote  the  destinations  as  an international tourist destination. It is therefore the purpose of  this  course  to  expose  students  to  the intricacies of planning, managing, facilitating and executing such events

## MGMT6136: Tourism Entrepreneurship &amp; Innovation Management

The  creation  of  new  business,  especially  in  a  small, open  economy,  has  significant  implications  for  the development  of  the  country  in  general  and  the tourism industry in particular. It is therefore the aim

of this course to develop the students' understanding of the process of and context of entrepreneurship as well  as  to  provide  key  concepts  which  will  enable them to take advantage of the mushroom of entrepreneurial  opportunities  that  accompany  the increased  investments  in  the  hospitality  sector  and the general tourism system.

## Quantitative &amp; Qualitative Research Methodologies for Managerial Decision-Making:

This course is offered in two parts.

Part A highlights the use of research in operational and strategic decision-making, including key algebraic tools and other measurement issues in the global business environment. The growing trend of combining quantitative and qualitative research methodologies will be explored.  A wide array of methods will be examined with attention being paid to the strengths and weaknesses of a variety of data collection methodologies.  Upon completion participants will be able to formulate a research question, compile a comprehensive literature review, collect requisite data, and analyze and interpret with select statistical packages.  The value of this course to participants will be realized in the DBA programme and in any other research undertaking.

This component has an examination.

## Part B

## Proposal Writing:

Grounded in theoretical frames, we introduce the practical techniques for writing solid proposals for three critical and diverse audiences

- a) Academic research papers.
- b) Investment proposals
- c) Government/ International

Agency funding proposal Guidance on selecting and refining the appropriate research methodology to suit the intended audience will be provided.  Critical to this segment will be an understanding of the ethics of research, the evaluation of research and the conceptualization of a research paper. The output from this segment will be the development of three types of proposals.

## Multivariate Statistical Analysis

This course emphasizes the use and application of multivariate data analysis for analyzing problems involving multiple variables.  The course introduces students to an overall understanding of multivariate statistical methods and guides them through the application of these methods for analyzing typical data sets that may be encountered in the dissertation phase of the programme, subsequent research undertakings, and for solving practical problems in business management. Students will be taught the appropriate use and application of the following statistical analytical techniques: Multiple Regression Analysis; Logistic Regression; Multiple Discriminant Analysis; Factor Analysis; Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA); Canonical Correlation Analysis; Cluster Analysis,

Multidimensional Scaling; Introduction to Structural equation modeling (SEM). Students will be required to use popular statistical packages, such as SPSS,

SASS, STATA, or E-Views to do the required statistical computing.

## Global Management Trends

Predominantly using case studies, participants will examine the experiences of the last three decades to analyze emerging management mega trends and key variables on managerial practice.  The course will focus on the impact of society on management, the impact of culture, values and ethics on customers, organizations, employees and society. Additionally, the course will examine among other things, the extra regional thrust towards mergers and acquisitions, spin offs, and its implications for corporate governance, nation building and achieving financial results.

## Strategic Use of Information and Communications Technologies

The course seeks to equip participants with the knowledge to bridge concepts and practice in order to respond to the challenges and opportunities facing Caribbean organisations in the adoption and diffusion of ICT, for strategic enablement and increased global competitive positioning in the information revolution. It provides insights into the key managerial issues surrounding management and use of ICT and other linked technologies in organizations as a strategic corporate resource.

The University of the West Indies

Participants will gain an awareness of approaches for appropriating ICT to enhance organizational competency and competitive advantage from a Caribbean perspective

## Business Development, Entrepreneurship and Innovation :

This course explores the critical success factors of the contemporary firm, given the reality that firms, regardless of size, geographic location and apparent financial strength have no guarantees of survival in today's environment. It covers some of the basics of business development and innovation management and focuses on redefining business practices and nurturing and harnessing innovation within the Caribbean context with the use of research and development. Topics to be covered include innovation of products and processes for customer value, new product development process, commercializing innovations, business intelligence, risk identification and negotiation skills, among others. It should be emphasized that a great part of the course focuses on managing new product development (NPD) processes in business organizations.

## International Marketing

Under the overall theme of "business and marketing across national boundaries', this course focuses on

examining the notion of the 'global village' and related issues. We will explore the implications of homogenization of consumer tastes within this global village, as well as assess future trends and their potential impact on international business and marketing strategy. The course focuses on both regional and global issues and encompasses both larger and smaller firms. It is structured so as to provide an appropriate environment for the students to explore issues concerning the need for strategic adjustments, including research and development, to enhance innovativeness and competitiveness at the corporate and national levels. The overall objective of this course is to examine issues related to business and marketing across national boundaries within the context of the Caribbean Single Market.

## Finance

Finance focuses on the financial structure and problems of corporations, as well as the organization and operation of markets and financial institutions within the ambits of the domestic and international political economy. It deals with the development and maintenance of sound financial policies, the organization and behavior of financial markets and investors, and the influence of public policies and investor psychology on financial markets and on corporate finance. The Concept of sustainable growth will also be introduced as it is an important organizing framework when working with financial

statements. Relatively new, especially to the Caribbean markets, are certain innovative financial products, especially derivatives, which will also be explored.

The Corporate Finance component will have specific reference to three (3) important questions faced by financial managers

- · What long term investment should the firm take on? This is the capital budgeting decision and the valuation of securities.
- · How can cash be raised for the required investment? These are the financing, the capital structure and cash determination decisions.
- · How to structure incentive and control systems to manage firms and optimize performance and value?

Among the topics to be included are:

- · Financial Incentives and Corporate Control
- · Valuation of Projects, Financial Assets and the Firm
- · Sourcing Financial Resources, Capital Structure &amp; Payout Policy
- · Behavioral Finance
- · Financial Risk Management and Derivatives
- · Financial Markets and Institutions
- · Taxation and Financial Decision making
- · Exchange Rate Determination

Internationalization of SMEs

The University of the West Indies

Using case studies and building upon stage model theory, network theory and organization capabilities perspective of internationalisation, this course examines the factors that are encouraging the rapid internationalization of SMEs and seeks to identify factors critical to the success of the internationalisation process given the dynamics of international trade systems, which impacts the business environment. Contemporary coping strategies such as alliances, and utilizing the diaspora will also be examined.

A heavy reliance will be placed on the operational data of regional SMEs and access by candidates to this data therefore becomes critical. Candidates will also be exposed to proposal writing techniques relevant to the International fora.

## Global Competitiveness

Central to the teaching of this course is promotion of the understanding that it is firms and not countries that compete. Within this context the course will focus on the competitive pressures from increasing trade openness and globalization and how it forces domestic firms to upgrade their techniques and technologies in order to compete with imports and internationally through exports. The course will also demonstrate that there is the need for the macroeconomic framework and the institutional environment to foster and promote innovation as

important within the context of building globally competitive firms and by extension a competitive economy. The course will also stress that firms seeking to upgrade, often do so incrementally, and require a continuous stream of information, technical and business development services (BDS).

A key component of this course will be the examination of Country Case Studies. The focus will include case studies of small open economies that have succeeded in fostering a high level of competitiveness, carving out high value-added niches in the global economy. The cases should briefly review the technological performance of the firms in these countries and describe the main policies and programs. In particular, the study should highlight how the firms with or without government support programs have overcome the barriers in terms of size of the domestic market, technology transfer from abroad and low domestic capacity. Further, the experiences should be contrasted to the status of technology adoption and public policies in the Caribbean.

## Strategy Dynamics

Given volatility within the business environment, success largely depends on precise anticipation of market trend, quick responses to customer needs, indicative of finely honed creative and strategic thinking. With the use of cases, this course seeks to identify fluid strategies for dealing with complex, volatile and uncertain environments.

The course will show that for a company to succeed it must weave its key business processes into hardto-imitate strategic capabilities and distinguish it from its competitors. Capability will be presented as a set of business processes strategically understood. The course will demonstrate that such capabilities are collective and cross-functional - a small part of many people's jobs, not a large part of a few people's job.

With the use of case studies we will undertake a comparative analysis of strategies employed by successful and unsuccessful companies. The focus will be on the four key principles of capabilities-based competition. These principles are:

- · Business Processes;
- · Transforming a company's key processes into strategic capabilities that consistently provide superior value to the customer;
- · The key role of making strategic investment in support infrastructure that links together all business units and functions; and
- · Presenting the CEO as the champion of capabilities-based strategy.

## LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS

## Comparative Labour Relations

This course provides a comparative picture of the legal framework of many institutions of labour, procedures and various means for dispute settlement

The University of the West Indies

in the collective bargaining process, and generally for the conduct of industrial relations in the English speaking Caribbean. The course seeks to address relevant questions concerning the future of Caribbean labour relations such as: What is the future model for an effective labour relations system? Should the system be more voluntary, or more legalistic, or more of a consensus-based model? Can the use of the political methods now be effectively and strategically employed to explore the potential of national social partnership accords for economic and social development? Can the consensus-based model, as exists in Ireland and Barbados, offer new possibilities for national development strategies in the Caribbean?

## Labor and Employment Law

This course surveys and analyzes the laws governing labor relations and employee rights in the workplace. It examines the legal framework in which collective bargaining takes place, including union organizational campaigns, negotiations for and enforcement of collective bargaining agreements, and the use of economic and political pressure. The second half of the course explores the adequacy of existing laws against discrimination based on race, religion, sex, residence, age, and disability.

## Labour Economics

Focuses on both the economic analysis of unions and collective bargaining in our economy and the economic forces that affect collective bargaining. The method is to identify and conceptualize the structural determinants of relative bargaining power. On this basis, the course examines both the economic outcomes of collective bargaining and current bargaining trends in a variety of industries. Tentative theoretical analyses of unionism (neoclassical, institutionalist) are compared. The statistical techniques and empirical results of research on the union effect on economic outcomes (wages, prices, inflation, profits, productibility, earnings inequality) are also evaluated. The effect of technology, corporate structures, and public policy on union bargaining power is outlined, and a number of case studies of collective bargaining in the private sector are reviewed.

## Workplace Negotiation and Conflict Management

This course explores the theory and practice of negotiations as applied in the context of a business. The course is intended primarily for students preparing for a career in Human Resource Management, Industrial Relations or in general management. Many of the principles encountered in this course will be applicable to problem solving and conflict resolution in other aspects of life.

The objective is to expose students to the theory and practice of negotiation as it applies to workplace and the models for managing conflict that are appropriate to the resolution of intra-organisational disputes.

## ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT

## Psychology Of Motivation &amp; Group Behaviour

The underlying causes of stress in an organization will be examined to determine their co-relation with the behaviour of people in an organizational setting. Comparisons will be made with the activities in a social setting by groups.  Group dynamics and interpersonal behaviour and the effect on group decision-making will also be studied.  Topics will include:

Workgroup behaviour vs. social group behaviour

Group dynamics and interpersonal behaviour

Group decision-making

Occupational Stress

## Psychological Measurement, Testing Assessment

This course will explore the application of assessment tools for leadership development and succession planning, employment and selection, team building and organizational functioning.  The concept of

The University of the West Indies

emotional intelligence will be examined and compared with IQ testing and contemporary psychological testing and measurement tools including:

## Vocational Testing

Differential Aptitude Testing

Personality Testing

Personality Typing

## Performance Management

The critical role that efficient performance plays in an organization's success gives rise to the need for innovation in the management of that performance. Internal business processes will be examined and reengineered as well as the approaches to recognition of performance.  The effect of incentives on performance and the financial implications will also be examined.    Topics will include:

Internal Business Processes

Reinforcement, Awards and Merits

Financial Measurements of Business Performance

Complex Organizations, Transformation

Management and Change

The mechanistic view of organizations as perceived by classical scientists that involved fixed theories using linear methods will be revisited and juxtaposed with modern non-linear approaches to organizational design and development as demanded by the dynamic changes necessitated by the business environment.

- · Theories of Complexity
- · The Learning Organization and Transformation
- · Chaos Theory
- · Initiating and Managing Change

## POLICY, GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT

## Collaborative and Network Governance

(i) The course will look at the governance of contract and collaborative networks (resource sharing, formal contract network, joint program network), the blurring of boundaries with the involvement or incorporation of the state into such networks. Networks are horizontal, but when the state sector gets involved the structure becomes horizontal. It will be one of the paramount lessons of the course to decipher what these complexities are and how they affect programme outcomes. Sector study areas will include: disaster management, poverty reduction, social protection, crime fighting.

(ii) Private participation in policy and service delivery: public goods production, public infrastructure development and public-private partnership (legal and policy underpinnings, procurement and contracts management, project financing and corporate tax issues). The governance of water, roads, electricity and the need to include community and cultural institutions in the processes of decision-making.

## Public Budgeting Policy and Development Performance Outcomes

This will look at models of public budgeting and developmental outcomes. It will involve examination and evaluative assessment of Throne Speeches and budgets from 1989-2005. It will involve hands-on research and examination of national budgets (Caribbean).

## International Public Policy

This course examines global, regional and local efforts at disaster management, pandemics and evaluations of performance. It seeks to explore whether size and relative affluence have been inhibiting factors in response and planning and implementation.

## Harmonization of Sectoral and Regional Policy

Utilizing lesson drawing from the E.U. experience, this course examines the attempts at regional policy

The University of the West Indies

harmonization by CARICAD and their member states, with specific focus on barriers to implementation, capacity deficits and focuses on a coherent procedural framework to accomplish the harmonization objectives.

## HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

## Human Capital Development

This course will explore current issues and strategies for the identification, development and retention of human capital. In particular, it will examine the strategic relevance of recruitment and selection, training and development and performance management strategies for the development and retention of the high-performing workforce. It will also demonstrate how workforce diversity can be used as a strategy to facilitate organizational learning and further used to promote creativity and innovation. In keeping with contemporary trends in this field, the course will further present techniques for the assessment of human capital and the

calculation of its contribution to the asset base of organizations. A necessary component of this course will be the requirement to demonstrate the practical relevance of these strategies through the application of the principles developed to live business situations.

## Knowledge Management

Many researchers consider knowledge to be the key resource for today's organization. The major challenge for organizations, however, lies in their capabilities to move knowledge from the tacit dimension (within the employee) to the explicit dimension where it can be codified and made available to the wider organization community. Within this context, the course will examine the concept of knowledge in both the tacit and explicit dimensions and explore the process by which knowledge can be created, processed, stored, shared, and finally, used to create new knowledge that can add significant value for the organization.

The course will also examine the evolution of knowledge management from a technology-based application to the emerging trends marked by the increasingly use of the term, 'intellectual capital' to highlight the importance of human capital, intellectual assets, and structural capital.

## Cross-cultural Management

This course will explore the cultural issues involved in managing and trading across boundaries. It will also examine issues in ethics, the corporate responsibility of transnational corporations, and communications across borders and cultures. A key component of the course will be a requirement to examine the initiatives of organizations based in the Caribbean that have pursued global expansion strategies.

## Comprehensive Examination

The university requires that students in the Clinical Psychology Programme take a comprehensive examination for completion of the programme. The comprehensive examination is held once per year and administered over a period of two days in the month of July in the second year of study. A student may not take the comprehensive examination until he or she has completed all requirements for the master's degree, with exception of the research paper.

Students must pass both days to pass the comprehensive exam. A student who fails an area of the  comprehensive  examination  is  required  to  be retested on that area during the subsequent administration of the examination. A student is allowed  to  fail  any  given  area  only  once.  Failing  an area twice results in termination of the student from the clinical programme.

Programme Coordinator: Dr. Stacey Brodie- Walker Stacey.brodie@uwimona.edu.jm

A student's performance on the examination should reflect the body of knowledge that he or she has gained during graduate training. The examination is comprehensive and preparation for it is not limited to a review of coursework. The examination questions are essay questions, and good answers involve integration across a broad range of material. The two days focus on different areas: Day I Psychotherapy and Day II - Assessment.

## Higher Degrees Diploma in Human Resource Development

Programme Objectives:

This programme seeks to distil a package from the functional courses offered in the MSc.  Human  Resource  Development  degree.    It  is  designed  to  offer  continuing education credits either to persons who already possess at least a Bachelors degree and  who  work  in  an  administrative  capacity  with  the  human  capital  of  the organisation but who do not have the requisite academic training for their posts or to  persons  who  take  it  for  continuing  education  credits  as  prescribed  by  an recognised professional body.

The programme will rest upon the foundation of the various curricula in which the students  registered  have  participated.    It  will  benefit  from  their  rich  practical problem-solving skills and this advantage will naturally extend to the Masters and Doctoral  Programmes  where  these  students  share  classes  with  those  students  as well.  These skills will be developed further through a combination of coursework, research activities, independent study and experiential learning.

Entry Requirements ( For the Particular Programme) :

Candidates  for  this  Higher  Degree  Diploma  will  be  required  to  have  a  minimum requirement  of  a  Bachelors  degree  and  at  least  three  years'  post-graduation practical work experience at a senior management level.  Alternatively, candidates may be accepted where they are taking the course for continuing education credits for  certification  by  the  Nursing  Association  of  Jamaica,  the Medical  Association of

Jamaica or for a similar professional body that has entered into this agreement with the  University.    Where  the  candidates  do  not  fall  into  these  categories  and  they cannot submit to the University a statement from their employer stating that the qualification  is  vital  for  the  survival  of  the  organisation,  they  will  be  required  to either  register  for  the  Masters  Programme  in  Human  Resource  Development  or register for the individual courses without the formal terminal diploma certification.

It  should  be  noted  that  once  committed  to  the  Diploma  candidates  may  opt  to upgrade their registration to the full MSc. Human Resource Development Degree. Upgrading  will  then  require  the  candidate  to  seek  permission  formally  from  and change their registration at the Office of Graduate Studies and pay any difference in the  requisite  tuition  fees.    They  may  then  apply  for  credit  exemptions  for  the courses  already  taken.    Alternatively,  persons  registered  for  the  MSc.  Human Resource Development may opt to qualify at the diploma status if for some reason they cannot continue in the Masters Programme.  The HRD Graduate Programmes will  determine the portion, if any, of the tuition fees paid for the Masters Degree that will be refunded.

Duration of programme: The Higher Degrees Diploma in Human Resource Development is offered on a part-time basis only.  Students are expected to complete all requirements for the programme in twenty-seven months.

Programme Structure: (Subject to change)

The Diploma Programme in Human Resource Development will be delivered on a part-time basis over a two-year period. It comprises 21 credits from taught courses. The schedule of taught courses includes 13 courses that are structured into modules ranging from 1-3 credits.  These courses cover a range of content areas that include human resource theory and opportunities for personal development.

## Course Description:

## SY66A SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY I

This  course  is  intended  to  bring  the  student  to  a deeper  appreciation  of  the  origins  of  sociological thought  and  the  ideas  of  main  thinkers  during  the formative years of the discipline.  The objective is to establish a mastery of the bedrock subject matter in the discipline and to develop a critical eye.  Beyond the  subject  matter,  students  are  brought  to  the epistemological and ontological bases of social thought.    The  emphasis  is  on  the  meta-theory,  not simply theory.

## SY66B SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY II

This course builds on the classical theories of Semester I.  It is intended to bring the student to a deeper understanding of the 20 th Century developments  in  sociology.    Apart  from  being  a continuation of the classical material, the objective is to  raise  some  of  the  critical  issues  in  contemporary sociology.    Like  the  preceding  course  it  is  metatheoretical.  Yet, one main concern is the search for a Caribbean sociology.    In  the  end  it  is  expected  that the  student  will  raise  and  answer  questions  about the nature of sociological theory today.

## SY62A ADVANCED SOCIAL RESEARCH METHODS I

This course will introduce students to some of the important theoretical and methodological issues related to the use of the scientific method in social research. By the end of this course participants should be able to use and critically assess a variety of techniques of analysis. Additionally, they should have developed a fairly high level of competence in one of the techniques of analysis.

## SY62B ADVANCED SOCIAL RESEARCH METHODS II

This objectives of this course are to: critically appraise the social scientific method in regard to its role  in  helping  to  explain  social  reality  examine  the methodological  bases  of  theory  construction  in  the social sciences; examine the epistemological bases of selected approaches to social research methods.

## SOCI6120 INTEGRATED METHODOLOGY FOR SOCIAL RESEARCH

This  course  will  be  delivered  in  two  semesters.  The first sections serve to provide the foundation for the core of the course. The course starts with an introduction that places emphasis on philosophy and the rationale for mixed  methodology,  and  then proceeds  to  examine  key  issues  in  research  design. Subsequent sessions deal with the nuts and bolts of

the  research  process,  and  the  interaction  between the  research  findings  as  they  emerge.  Once  the Research  Group  has  agreed  on  a  theme  for  the research  undertaking,  and  participants  have  been assigned  to  research  teams,  preliminary  fieldwork will be initiated in order to develop and structure this proposed theme.

## Course Description:

## SW60A: Professional Development and Ethical Issues in Human Services

This course is intended to deepen students' awareness of the importance of ethics in their day to day work as human service professionals; to develop their skills in ethical decision-making and to assist them in internalizing norms of professional conduct appropriate to their profession and field of service. The course will also be a vehicle for increasing students' professional commitment to the creation of effective and just policies for the people of the Caribbean.

## SW64A: Theory Development for Advanced Social Work Practice

The course is designed to examine, from a generalist perspective, current social work theories and development of theories which underpin social work practice across systems of different sizes individuals, families, groups, communities and organizations.

The course will provide in-depth knowledge and evaluation of the utility of (a) competing social work theories; (b) models of change; (c) the process of interaction between professional social workers and

the various client systems, thereby improving the competencies in theory building, research, evaluation and practice.  The course will concentrate on significant areas of focus in order to bring out specific intervention methods that are appropriate for practice with people of the region.

Students in the different sequences and specializations in the graduate programme will be expected to apply their understanding of theory development across all the modalities of social work practice.  Through carefully designed seminars which will be held monthly, students will be expected to conceptualize how these relate to contemporary social issues through critical thinking and analysis.

## SY65A:  Social Policy and Administration I

This course provides a foundation in social policy and administration. Its aims are to examine ideas on and approaches to social policy, both Caribbean-wide and internationally,  in  the  context  of  rapidly  changing political, economic  and  social  ideas  about  social conditions, social needs  and  social  interventions; review Caribbean social policies in both the historical and contemporary setting; develop graduate student skills  in  policy  analysis,  policy  planning  and  policy implementation.

SW61A:

Human Resource Management and

Organization

This course will focus on the strategic management of human resource by human service administrators. In so doing, emphasis will be placed on (1) the role of administrators in statutory and non-governmental organizations in the Caribbean; (2) strategic managers, rather than on operational activities that belong to the area of personnel management; (3) analyzing and testing corporate strategic issues.

## SW61B: Methods of Strategic Management in Human Services

This course will focus on the theory and practice of strategic management in human services. It will examine existing and emerging theories and concepts and the interaction between administration, management, policy and strategy.

## SW64C: Programme Planning, Management and Evaluation

This course seeks to equip participants with a set of skills in programme management, including programme planning, budgeting, monitoring and evaluation.

SW62C: Financial Management for the Human Services not offered 2008/2009

The University of the West Indies

This course seeks to provide an introduction to Financial Management for the Human Services. However, in order to appreciate Financial Management, students require some level of exposure to Accounting. In light of this, the earlier half of the course is devoted to the introduction of basic Financial Accounting and basic Management Accounting concepts respectively. The latter half will then focus on basic Financial Management issues within the Human Services.

## SW66C: Methods of Policy Practice (See

under Community Organization and Policy Practice)

## SW65A: Advanced Clinical Social Work Practice

This course will give the advanced student intense and comprehensive exposure to the methods, practice skills and techniques of clinical intervention with individuals, groups and families within a generalist framework.

The student will be exposed to some broad-based techniques for preliminary assessment, as well as techniques of goal setting and treatment planning used with individuals, groups and families. Focus will be on psycho-social interventions with individuals, groups and families within the context of their

environment, utilizing selected problems of social functioning with Caribbean societies.

Students will have the opportunity to examine issues of empowerment in working with disadvantaged and dispossessed client populations. This course will involve the use of an integrated journal

At the end of the course students will present an Advanced Clinical Seminar on Innovations in Social Work Practice that they may have developed for working with specific client populations. This seminar, which will be for the benefit of academics, other students and field instructors, together with the integrated journals, will form part of the assessment process for this course.

*Coursework will involve a major paper which will be presented orally to field personnel and academics at the end of the semester, on the student's perspectives of the different phases of work of a single assigned case. (Advanced Clinical Seminar)

## SW65B:        Evaluation of Clinical Social Work Practice

The central theme of this course is the assessment of client systems in terms of

Their operation and functioning. This will include exposure to practice evaluation techniques in all three social work settings. The course will foster the cultivation of habits of scholarly enquiry as they

relate to social work practice with children and families in the Caribbean. Students will review outstanding research studies, examine the research literature in relation to direct intervention with children and families in all practice modalities and will carry out evaluations of their own practice.

## SW65C: Group Counselling / Therapy

This course is both theoretical and practical in nature.  Theories,  models  and  techniques  will  be examined from both generalist and clinical perspectives within the context of critical issues and problems  requiring  group  counselling  interventions. Students are expected to participate in selfexploration and leadership activities as part of their own development as group counsellors. In addition, the  course  will provide  'hands  on'  exposure  of organizing  and  implementing  a  group  counselling project  which  will  require  students  to  participate  in at least one, and possibly two week-ends, of workshop/counselling activities.

## SW68B:  Family Therapy

This course will provide students with an opportunity to understand the theoretical concepts and techniques of family therapy as they apply to social work  practice.  In  pursuing  this  course,  the  student will  have  an opportunity to integrate class and field experiences with a special focus on family

assessment and treatment. There will be an emphasis on professional awareness and selfevaluation.  Students  will develop  perceptual  and conceptual skills that enable them to identify transactional patterns in families and to understand family  functioning  from  a  systems  perspective.  A range  of  strategies  will  be  examined,  involving  the differential use of contemporary therapeutic modalities, particularly as they relate to their usefulness for the Caribbean.

## SW68C: Social Work  Assessment  and  Treatment: Children and Adolescents

This course is designed to equip the advanced clinical student with the necessary skills to administer a range of assessment instruments and tools for work with children and adolescents.  Students will be exposed to assessment techniques and procedures that will assist in formulating differential treatment plans for children and adolescents in crisis situations (brief treatment) as well as in situations needing longer-term treatment.

Students will do an applied clinical exposure over an eight-week period where they will be exposed to the use of assessment protocols available in contemporary clinical settings.  This will include computer applications of assessment procedures such as The 'Eco-Scan', a system of assessing individuals and families within their environment and

Computer-Assisted Social Services (CASS), an intake system for assessing the basic social status of clients in any social service agency.

*Coursework will consist of a major paper involving the development of a detailed assessment protocol and treatment plan for an assigned case.

## SW66A: Advanced Community Practice

The objectives of this course are to build on the foundation of earlier undergraduate studies by deepening the students' understanding of contemporary theoretical and practice trends in the areas of group and community work/organization; facilitating students' application of this knowledge to the study and analysis of a range of practice situations; enabling students to achieve a greater sophistication and mastery of skills in Course Description:

## Doctoral Programme in Organisational Behaviour

The  PhD  in  Organisational  Behaviour  was  developed  in  response  to  the  need  for advanced  training  and  indigenous  research  in  human  resource  development  and organisation in the Jamaican and Caribbean business landscape.  The gap between our needs and the resources to meet these requirements was most apparent in the wake of the drive to re-train persons after the wave of organisational restructuring in both the public and private sectors in the 1990s and early 2000s, the rethinking of Jamaica's  industrial  relations  norms  and  with  the  imperative  of  contending  with regional and international trade and political blocs.   It became necessary, therefore, to expand the faculty for academic programmes in Human Resource Development at  the  UWI  and  increasing  the  effectiveness  of  the  organisational  behavioural practitioners in the region.

Developing  the  course  locally  was  expected  to  prove  significantly  more  costeffective for the participants and meet the UWI's needs for new staff and Caribbean research more expeditiously than would a plan of encouraging our alumni and staff members to pursue such studies abroad.  Indeed, there was a strong demand from our HRD graduates that the Unit expand training to this more advanced level.

## Programme Objectives:

The  programme  is  designed  to  develop  scientists  and  practitioners  who  are prepared  adequately  for  an  academic  or  a  professional  career  in  organisational analysis and intervention, whether in consultancy or within industry or the public sector.    This  doctoral  programme  will  seek.  therefore,  to  provide  the  theoretical foundation and the technical skills needed to understand the complex issues which arise from social interaction within organisations.

## Entry Requirements :

It  is  expected  that  students  who  are  admitted  to  the  doctoral  programme  will already have a Masters degree with a substantial background in management or the behavioural  sciences.  Although  the  Masters  degree  is  not  required,  it  is  highly recommended,  as  the  programme  is  designed  for  persons  with  demonstrated academic  abilities.  Successful  applicants  are  likely  to  be  those  with  at  least  a  B+ average  during  their  graduate  programme.  Admission  decisions  are  based  on evaluation  of  the  complete  record  for  the  applicant,  which  includes  academic performance, work experience, evaluations and recommendations and evidence of motivation  and  skills  relevant  for  a  successful  professional  career.  These  include writing  and  communication  skills.    Personal  interviews  will  be  conducted  with  all applicants.

## Areas of Research

Open to all areas of organisational behaviour and human resource development.

## Seminars

The  Doctoral  Programme  in  Organisational  Behaviour  requires  at  least  three seminar courses.    The  programme  lists  12  elective  courses  of  which  students  are required to do eight credits (three or four courses).  These courses are listed below.

Duration of programme: The PhD Organisational Behaviour is offered on a parttime  basis  only.    Students  are  expected  to  complete  all  requirements  for  the programme, including the two Practica and the Dissertation, in six years. It should be noted, however, that the number of credit exemptions received for work done prior to joining the programme will have a significant impact upon the time taken to complete the programme.

## Programme Structure: (Subject to change)

The structure of the Ph.D. programme is organised into two levels. The first level is designed  to  allow  students  with  different  academic  backgrounds  to  acquire  a common  set  of  competencies,  so  as  to  be  able  to  pursue  the  more  advanced

graduate  courses.  Level  1  is  therefore  a  combination  of  existing  graduate-level courses  drawn  from  the  Masters  in  HRD,  and  the  Masters  in  Applied  Psychology. Equivalent  courses  from  the  MBA  (Human  Resource  Management  Option)  are acceptable.    Collectively  these  are  equivalent  to  24  credits,  although  it  is  not expected  that  most  candidates  will  require  all  of  these  courses.  It  is  only  in  the situation  where  candidates  are  allowed  direct  entry  and  are  admitted  without  a prior  M.Sc. degree in a related field that all of these courses will be required.  In addition, it will be necessary for direct-entry candidates to meet the departmental requirement for Level II undergraduate statistics and qualitative research methods, in the event that they do not already have this qualification, or the equivalent.

Where  these  direct-entry  candidates  do  not  proceed  beyond  Level  1  of  the programme,  they may  apply to transfer to the M.Sc. in Human  Resource Development  programme.  They  will  be  eligible  for  the  award  of  this  M.Sc.  on satisfactory  completion  of  specified  courses  in  (i)  research  methods  and  statistics and (ii) Industrial Relations.  They will be required to complete the Minor Practicum but not the Research Paper.

The second level of the programme will include 15 courses. The core courses are all 3-credit offerings

except for the Dissemination Skills and Ethics courses that are both one credit each. The  courses  in  research  methodology  and  quantitative  analysis  are  also  3-credit offerings.    Additionally,  students  will  be  required  to  take  four  seminars,  each  of which is two credits.  The structure of the programme is summarised below:

- /square4 7 courses in organisational studies
- /square4 4 courses in research methodology and statistics
- /square4 4 seminars in the specialisation

/square4

In addition to the formal course work, doctoral candidates will pursue experiential learning  and  independent  research.    The  experiential  learning  comprises  two practica, which together require 620 hours of placement and related activities and are  equivalent  to  11  credits.  These  practica  have  been  designed  to  develop

## The University of the West Indies

professional  competence and given the nature of the discipline will develop skills and orientations in an applied way.  The competencies developed in the practicum setting will include such areas as problem-solving, counselling, training and coaching.  These placements will be accompanied by structured skill-development workshops with trained practicum supervisors under the supervision of an overall academic coordinator.

The  research  requirements  for  this  degree  are  a  6-credit  research  paper  and  a dissertation which is equivalent to 24 credits. The research paper is expected to be 12-15,000 words, while the dissertation is in the region of 60,000 words.  Students will be required to take a written comprehensive examination on completion of the doctoral courses. This examination will be based on the material covered in the core courses  and  the  seminars,  and  the  candidate  is  expected  to  demonstrate  an integrated understanding of these areas.

Students  who  for  any  reason  do  not  proceed  beyond  the  coursework  stage  may apply for the award of the Master of Science in Organisational Studies.  To receive this MSc.  degree,  students  will  not  be  required  to  take  the  comprehensive examination or to undertake the major practicum, but they will need to successfully complete all of the 15 doctoral courses and seminars.

The University of the West Indies

## SB61E - Organisational Development and Change (3 Credits)

This course will provide students with the knowledge and skill  to  become  sensitive  and  responsive  to  the challenge of organisational change. Despite its importance  in  any  era,  the  course  is  of  particular value to present and prospective managers, given the turbulence  of  rapid  change  being  experienced  by organisations in the Caribbean at present. The course provides participants with practical tools and techniques  in  business  diagnosis,  business  problem solving and change management.

## SY67A  -  Social  Psychology:  Self  and  Interaction  (3 Credits)

This course  establishes  the  nature  of  the  'social psychological enterprise' at the conceptual methodological, institutional and practical levels. After a brief historical overview, the course develops on  the current state of the discipline of social psychology;  examining  general  issues  and  problems in theory and in method and reviewing, mainly from a  psychological  social  psychology  perspective,  the topics of self, attitude, persuasion, perception, interpersonal communication and interaction.

SY67B  -  Social  Psychology:  Group  Dynamics  and Intergroup Relationships (3 Credits)

This course examines both intra-group relations and inter-group  relationships.  Attention  is  given  to  the impact of the group situation on judgment, decisionmaking and task performance, and there is also an indepth  review  of  the  fundamentals  of  inter-group relationships  and  of  the  procedures  for  mediation and conflict resolution.

## SY67C -Method and Measurement in Social Psychology (3 Credits)

This course covers the basics of method and measurement in Social Psychology. It reviews research  deign  formats  in  Social  Psychology  and examines procedures for data collection and analysis. Most  of  the  course-time  however,  is  spent  on  the construction  and  application  of  various test and measurement  protocols.  Although  several  general issues,  principles  and  problems  are  identified  and discussed, this course is more practical than theoretical and is more directed to an applied social psychology.

## HR79B/SS79B - Research Writing

This  course  is  designed  to  ground  students  in  the techniques of producing academic research proposals and papers and technical reports for business and in the oral dissemination of the findings of their research studies and  consultancies. The objectives of the course are four-fold.  Primarily, the

course  has  been  developed  for  students  who  must report in a succinct and clear manner the development,  exploration  and  testing  of  academic ideas  that  are  either  original  or  derived  from  the work  of  others. Further, the course  will teach students the intricacies of developing technical reports for corporate consultancies.

A third, but equally important objective is to advance students'  skills  in  disseminating  the  information  so developed.    For  this,  students  will  be  required  to apply  current  knowledge  and  norms  of  persuasion, argument,  critical  analysis  and  group  dynamics  to both written and oral information-dissemination exercises and presentations.  Finally, the course will set the stage for the production of technical reports, the  individual  Research  Paper  and  ultimately  the Thesis  to  be  produced  as  the  main  requirement  for the granting of the doctoral degree.

## LEVEL II COURSES

## [HR71A] HRNM7101-Contemporary Issues in Organisational and Social Psychology (3 Credits)

In  addressing  the  social  psychology  of  organisations this  course  looks  at  contemporary  issues  both  in social psychology  and  in  the  social  psychological processes in organisations. It also provides multidisciplinary coverage of the organisational contexts in which social psychologists may work in a

The University of the West Indies

variety  of  professional  domains.    Familiarity  with social  psychological  methods  is  assumed  but  their application within organisational processes and contexts will be examined in detail within the course.

The course aims to give a social psychological perspective on the elements of continuity and change  in  contemporary  organisational  life  allowing students to develop a critical and reflective understanding  of  these  key  processes.  The  course will  be  informed  throughout  by  a  dual  mandate:  a rigorous  approach  to  theory  yet  one  firmly  placed within the context of emerging organisational issues and relevant, current topics of debate.

## [HR71B]  HRNM7102  -  Psychological  Assessment  in Organisations (3 Credits)

This  is  a  course  in  theory  and  practice.    The  course covers the necessary skills that students will need to select, administer, interpret and report on the psychological assessment of individuals within organisations.

Students will learn how to administer tests of interest such as the Strong-Campbell Vocational Interest Inventory, Tests of Aptitude such as the Differential Aptitude Test, Tests of Personality such as the 16-PF; Behavioural  Sampling  Techniques  such  as  In-Basket Exercises  and  integrate  the  findings  of  these  into  a comprehensive report. As part of this course

students will be expected to conduct four assessments.

## HR72A] HRNM7201 - Legal, Ethical and Professional Behaviour (1 Credit)

This course will entail a review of the guidelines for the use and application for psychological tests internationally.    Material  will  be  derived  from  the Codes of Ethics for programme evaluators -American Evaluation Association, American Educational  Research  Association  and  the  Canadian Psychological Association among other sources. Group  discussion of ethical dilemmas  will be a feature  of  the  course.    Additionally,  students  will have a module  on the implications for human resource  practitioners  of  the  law  of  tort,  contracts, employment, intellectual property, partnerships and companies.

## [HR73A] HRNM7301 - Complex Organisations (3 Credits)

This  is  a  course  in  the  theory  of  organisations.  It surveys the current state of the art of organisational analysis  from  a  variety  of  disciplinary  perspectives. Particular emphasis is placed on identifying new and emerging organisational  networks  in  an  increasingly globalised world.

After  completing  the  course  the  student  should  be able to understand and explain

- 1. dimensions describing the organisational structure , including the degrees of formalisation, specialisation, standardisation, complexity,  and  centralisation;  the  shape  of the hierarchy of authority and the degree of professionalism among other parameters;
- 2. dimensions describing the organisational context , including the size of the organisation, the question of global scale, the technology, environment, goals and strategies and its internal culture;
- 3. how these contextual and structural dimensions are interrelated,  and
- 4. the mechanisms underlying major organisational processes including innovation and change, information processing and control, decision-making,  the  dynamics  of internal  politics  and  intergroup  conflict  and relationships among organisations and populations of organisations.

## HR73B [HRNM7302] - Strategic Leadership and Change Management (2 Credits)

This seminar will cover theories of leadership as well as group dynamics within a multi-cultural context. It also  incorporates  a  strong  practical  and  experiential component based on the recognition that leadership

The University of the West Indies

qualities  and  skills  are  linked  to  self-awareness,  the ability to manage oneself in different situations, and a  high  level  of  interpersonal  skills.  In  this  context, participants  will  have  the  opportunity  to  assess  and explore  their  leadership  experiences  and  styles  of communication,  with  the  aim  to  define  areas  of strength as well as areas that need further development.

The  course  provides  students  with  the  ability  to reflect upon  and improve  their capacity to act effectively as an  innovator  and  change  agent.  It introduces  students  to  the  nature  of  power  and politics in organisations, how  this dimension of organisational  life  impacts  upon  individual  careers and organisational success, commonly recommended approaches  and  techniques  for  managing  politics, and the personal and ethical issues involved in either participating in or abstaining from politics. The subject  reviews  current  management  research  on organisational politics and change management, and provides checklists, case studies, guidelines and exercises for improving the students' practical knowledge and experience.

People do not always resist change but rather tend to resist  being  changed.  This  theme  is  central  to  the focus of this course. The subject of change management  is  concerned  with  implementation  of

decisions through people. The management of people's response and reactions to the change process  is a key  leadership  skill to ensure  that management  decisions  can  be  realised.  The  course will compare literature on prescriptive approaches to change with descriptive perspectives by focusing on experiences and case studies.

## [HR73C ]HRNM7303 - Advanced Seminar in Organisational Design and Change (2 Credits)

Topics in this seminar include: nature of the organisation, history of organisational design, contemporary designs for vertical integration, diversification,  low-cost,  differentiation  and  mixed strategies; organisational environment, sociotechnical systems and organisational design problems. Additionally, organisations will be analysed from a macro perspective.

## [HR73D]  HRNM7304 - Organisational DecisionMaking (2 Credits)

This  seminar  considers  topics  from  organisational science and strategic management that are related to organisational decision making. Topics include organisational power and politics, managerial cognition, strategy formulation, organisational learning,  and  organisational  information  processing. The  course  is  concerned  with  how  decisions  and strategies are developed in organisations, rather than how they should be. The intent is to develop a better

understanding of organisational decision making, particularly at the top management level and particularly when the task is strategy formulation. A related  intent  is  to  review  and  develop  theories about organisational decision processes, and thereby help us predict the outcomes of these processes. The content of  the  course  is  based  on  the  readings  and in-class analysis of journal articles and book chapters.

## [HR73E] HRNM7305  -  Organisational Theory (2 Credits)

This foundation seminar aims to enhance participants' understanding of the impact of organisational  structures  and  managerial  strategies and  practices  on  people's  behaviour.    Students  will study  the  overall  relationship  of  management  and organisation structure and their impact on the performance  of  individuals  and  groups  within  the organisation.

The  second  objective  of  the  seminar  is  to  expose doctoral students to some major theoretical streams in the organisational and psychological theory domains  related  to  their  own  research  interests  so they can get some starting points for digging deeper

to  find  appropriate  theoretical  bases  that  they  can use in their own research investigations.

## [HR75A] HRNM7501 - Advanced Training (3 Credits)

This  course  will  focus  for  the  most  part  upon  the actual  performance  of  the  training  exercise  rather than taking the mainly theoretical approach used in the HR65A: Training Design, Delivery and Evaluation course  taught  in  the  programme  at  Level  I.    The course will involve site visits and the development of a training programme.

## [HR76A] HRNM7701 - Organisational Consulting (2 Credits)

This seminar involves the study, analysis and presentation of recommendations for solving significant problems confronting organisations. Specifically, it will provide an opportunity to explore action inquiry, the different perspectives on organisation,  review  current  consulting  practice  and the alternative approaches to the consulting process.

[HR78A] HRNM7801 - Computer Applications for Human Resource Management (3 Credits)

Firms that effectively exploit IT out-perform others. IT can play a major role in opening new distribution channels,  streamlining  supply  chains  and  providing efficient  electronic  markets.   But  many firms do not understand IT and do not manage it well. This course covers managerial applications and also helps students develop their understanding of the underlying technologies and the frameworks needed to successfully manage these.  The course also aims at  an  understanding  of  the  relationships  between information  technology and  information systems, business strategy and organisational improvement. It will  examine  information  technology  as  an  enabler and facilitator  of  business  strategy  and  as  a  control tool  to  track  performance  and  improve  managerial decision-making.

It would  involve training  specifically  in  writing  executive  summaries, technical  manuals  and  press  releases.    Additionally students would be taught how to engage the media. This  would  involve  handling  television,  radio  and telephone interviews, a radio interview and a telephone interview.  Students would specifically be

taught the wedge format in structuring messages to the media. Students would also be instructed in the proper use of the media to disseminate the findings of their work. They would  be  taught how  to negotiate an interview. Oral presentations to stakeholders will also be explored.

## [PS68A] PSYC6022 - Applied Health Psychology

In  this  graduate  seminar  we  will  review  the  major theories that have been developed by Health Psychologists,  and  explore  the  many  social  settings and  situations in which  this knowledge  may  be applicable. We will make a deliberate departure from the biomedical model, which assumes that psychological  and  social  processes  are  independent of the disease/health process. Rather, the biopsychosocial  model  will  guide  our  work  as  we explore  linkages  between  the  mind,  environment, and  the  body,  and  ways  in  which  this  interaction influences health and illness.

## [PS68R]  PSYC6032  -  Applied  Research  Methods  in Psychology and Organisational Behaviour (3 Credits)

## SALI6010 / Development Theory and Policy

Course Objectives:

The main objectives of the course are as follows:

- (i) To  develop  students'  critical  awareness  of  the main  lines  of  thinking  on  the  development  process and  to introduce them  to  the  main  issues and concepts employed in the discourse on development.
- (ii)  To  introduce  students  to  a  range  of  important policy issues in the development process.
- (iii) To enable students to locate specific development problems, policies and research topics in a broader theoretical context.

## SALI6011 / Policy Analysis &amp; Management

This  course  is  designed  to  expose  students  to  the tools of policy analysis and management. It provides theoretical perspectives and practical cases to demonstrate  the  formulation,  implementation  and evaluation of policies.

Students  will  acquire  state-of-the-art  skills  in  policy research and advanced

knowledge  of  the  field.  This  will  enable  them  to contribute to policy and project formulation, implementation and evaluation in the public, private and NGO sectors.

## SALI6012 / Research Methods in the Social Sciences

The principal  purpose  of  this  course  is  to  introduce students  to  the  main  issues  in  the  philosophy  of science and to foster a critical understanding of the main techniques of conducting social science research. The student will also be introduced to the basics of preparing a research paper.

In  this  course  the  student  will  become  acquainted with  social  research  methodologies  such  as  survey and  field research,  questionnaire  design,  content analysis, analysis of existing data, focus groups, individual and group observation (including participatory  observation)  etc.  The  course  will  also introduce students to the safeguards against errors in both data collection and data analysis and reports. In addition, the course will draw  the attention of students to an important but often neglected aspect of social research,

i.e.,  ethical  issues  in  social  research,  covering  such topics as voluntary participation, anonymity  and

confidentiality and the need to adhere to a professional code of ethics. How each method is, or may be related to contemporary policy issues, will be an integral part of the course.

Practical experience from studies done  in small countries  will  be  used  to  expose  the  students  to issues in social research.

## Institute of Gender &amp; Development Studies

Director of Institute/Centre: Professor Barbara Bailey, B.Sc. (General), B.Sc. (Med. Microbiology), Dip.Ed., PhD UWI

Established in 1993, the Institute of Gender and Development Studies is an autonomous interdisciplinary entity, which aims, through its programme of teaching, research and outreach, to question historically accepted theories and explanations about society and human behaviour, as well as to critically examine the origins of power differences between and among men and women and the range of factors which account for these differences.

The Institute's mandate is to:

- Develop an integrated, interdisciplinary programme of gender studies within the University, at both undergraduate and graduate levels.  This includes facilitating the incorporation of gender analysis in all disciplines.
- Produce and disseminate knowledge, based on the generation and analysis of research data on women, men, and gender related issues in the Caribbean.

Establish and maintain linkages with national, regional and international institutions concerned with gender and development, provide advisory services, influence policy directions and assist with capacity building in these institutions,

Located on all three campuses of the University, the impact of the work of the Institute is wide-ranging and far-reaching as it enjoys long established relationships and collaborations with local, regional and international development agencies, including CARICOM, the Caribbean Development Bank, the

United Nations, the Commonwealth Secretariat, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) and UK Department for International Development (DFID).

As the leading regional agency of expertise on issues of gender, the Institute has been instrumental in providing strategies to enhance awareness of the critical role played by the study of gender in national and regional development.

Graduates of the Institute join a cadre of professionals who are equipped with the knowledge and capacity to create a more equitable and gender-sensitive society.

## M.Sc and M.Phil/Ph.D in Gender and Development Studies

## Broad Outline of Courses

## MSc. Gender and Development Studies

## GEND6101:  Feminist Methodology and Epistemology

The overall intention of this course is to examine feminist challenges to traditional ways of generating and creating knowledge and therefore to examine contending quantitative and qualitative research paradigms and arguments for a feminist epistemology.

## GEND6502:  Gender Analysis in Policy and Planning

It is now recognised that women and men have different and unique needs and that in order to promote greater gender equality projects, programmes and policies at community and national levels need to take these differences into account. In this course students are equipped with the tools for carrying out a gender analysis and made aware of the planning frameworks that can be used to guide such a process. The process for developing, evidence-based, gender responsive policies is explored and the rationale for pursuing a gender mainstreaming strategy in the Caribbean is highlighted.

GEND6601A:   Gender and Development and Human Society

In this course students examine the concepts 'gender', 'development' and 'human development' and critically assess development paradigms in terms of their contribution to the project of gender equality and equity. The feminist critique of gender relations in national, regional and international development practices is examined and the extent to which development planning and interventions accommodate diversity in the social, economic and political roles of men and women across societies is also explored. Human and sustainable development approaches are positioned as contending developmental approaches and discussed in terms of their potential for promoting gender equality and social justice in Caribbean societies.

## GEND6302:  Gender, Education, Training and Work

This course is designed to assist participants to examine gender as a central organising structure in educational institutions and ways in which schooling, as an instrument of the State, reproduces and reinforces the gender system in the wider social order. Inequalities in education are examined, including debates on 'male underachievement' in relation to various theoretical paradigms advanced by educational

<!-- image -->

sociologists and feminist educators and the research agenda related to the feminist project is explored. Feminist critiques of educational philosophies are examined in relation to alternative feminist pedagogies. The course also focuses on women's involvement in the formal labour market and the relationship between educational outputs and wider social, economic and political outcomes for both sexes

## GEND 6402: Gender, Political Activism and Mobilisation

The course seeks to build an awareness of how patriarchy and gender as a central organising system continue to exclude women's participation in political decision-making and therefore affect the life experiences of families, communities and nations. The importance of engaging women in decision-making at the micro, meso and macro levels is presented as fundamental to the struggle for the transformation of governance structures and practices in the 21 st century.

- GEND 6201: Sex, Gender &amp; the Family Gender as a central system of social organisation is seen to be at work in the family and in household relations. In this course students interrogate patriarchal influences on and social norms related to family, family

## The University of the West Indies

relations and issues such as masculinity and femininity, sexuality, property rights, marriage and abortion. They also examine the feminist project which sets out to expose the patriarchal influence and sexist notions embedded in these issues and to reconceptualise and reconstruct these realities from a feminist perspective

GEND 6001:

Theories and Development

## of Feminisms

The overall aim of the course is to help students to appreciate the discursive strategies employed by philosophy and language in defining and constructing the category woman and womanhood as 'other', diseased and incomplete. The Caribbean experience is examined as a valid standpoint from which to interrogate and theorise the otherness of woman which is not only created on the basis of biological sex and social gender but on the basis of geopolitics.

## M.Phil.  / PhD Gender &amp; Development Studies

These degrees are issued on the basis of research only.  However, persons may be required to take relevant graduate level courses and where it is deemed necessary by the department with regards to their knowledge of gender and competency in (feminist) research methodologies. The courses that

are usually recommended are:

- 1. GEND 6001: Theories and Development of Feminisms
- 2. GS66A: Gender and Development in Human Society
- 3. GS61A:  Feminist Methodology and Epistemology
