## Message from the Dean

Dean's Message to Undergraduate Students in 2024/25

The study and practice of law can be an intellectually stimulating and a rewarding experience. At the Faculty of Law of the University of the West Indies, Mona ('MonaLaw'), we are honoured that you have chosen to commence your legal career with us.

At  times,  you  will  find  yourselves  challenged  by  the  novelty  and  complexity  presented  by  this  unique discipline. Yet, it is important that you persevere and remain committed to achieving your LLB degree.

In  this  quest,  you  should  be  guided  by  the  concept  of  Virtue  Ethics  -  an  idea  advanced  by  Aristotle  that embodies the 'pursuit of virtue, excellence, and the best within us'. If these values underpin your actions as a law student, and as a future member of the legal profession, they should help to ensure your well-being and, ultimately, that of the society.

As  you  pursue  this  venture,  MonaLaw  is  committed  to  providing  you  with  the  best  tuition,  support  and guidance needed to help you attain your goals.

On behalf of the Academic and Administrative staff of MonaLaw, I wish to extend a warm welcome to the incoming year one LLB students, as well as our returning second and final year undergraduates.

Best wishes as you follow your path to excellence!

Professor Shazeeda Ali LLB (UWI); LLM (Cantab); PhD (Lond); Attorney-at-Law Dean Faculty of Law The University of the West Indies Mona

## Message from the Faculty Guild Representative

Esteemed members of the Faculty of Law,

It  is  with  immense excitement and profound appreciation that I celebrate the commencement of a new journey for all of us. Welcome to the hub of greatness where legal luminaries are crafted and exceptional contributors to our nation's governance framework are nurtured.

At the heart of the Faculty of Law lies our vibrant student body, the Mona Law Society. We hold steadfast to our values, unified as one family guided by our common interest in the law and student development. As you join this family, recognize that you are a vital part of its growth and continuity. The journey you embark on, whether new or ongoing, demands focus, passion, discipline, and tenacity. These attributes are essential to  achieving  your  academic  aspirations.  The  Mona  Law  Society  and  the  Faculty  of  Law  encourage  all esteemed members to not only prioritize academic excellence but also to engage meaningfully in the broader aspects of faculty and university life.

I  eagerly  anticipate  seeing  each  of  you  integrate  into  the  culture  of  our  Faculty  and  the  MLS.  This  year promises to be vibrant, with spirited competitions among our houses - Barnett Bulls, Vasciannie Tigers, Kodilyne Dragons, and Carnegie Vipers - on sports day amongst other exciting events. We look forward to crowning the  next  Mr.  and  Miss  Law,  welcoming  brilliant  Honour  Society  inductees  and  Mooters,  and celebrating the introduction of our new mascot, "The EAGLE."

Let us strive for a year of excellence and success as we move forward together, united as 'One Law, One Family', 'Una Lex, Una Familiaris'.

Mr. Xavier McFadden President of the Mona Law Society (24/25)

Faculty of Law Representative on the UWI Mona Guild of Students (24/25)

The Faculty offers a Full-Fee Paying programme which affords students the opportunity to spend their first year at the Western Jamaica Campus and the second and third years at the Kingston Campus. Alternatively, students may spend all three years at Mona. The full-time programme attracts a cost of US$10,000 per Academic Year while parttime students pay US$1,100 per three-credit course. Applications remain open all year round.

The Faculty is prepared to consider applications from persons who do not strictly satisfy Matriculation standards but who have equivalent academic qualifications. In particular, mature applicants over 21 who have shown evidence of  academic  and  professional  achievement  can  be  considered.  (Reference  should  be  made  to  the  Regulations Governing Matriculation in the University Calendar). This may provide an opportunity to read for a Law degree for those  who  have  already  been  associated  with  the  practice  of  law  in  some  way  -  e.g.  clerks  of  the  courts,  legal assistants, civil servants, police officers and so on.

## PROFESSIONAL TRAINING

Entry into the legal  profession of  all  of  the  Commonwealth  Caribbean territories  is  regulated  by  the  law  of  the particular territory, but as a result of a regional agreement the basic requirements tend to follow a common pattern. Since 1975, a Legal Education Certificate is normally required by a prospective lawyer. This is granted by the (West Indian) Council of Legal Education which was established in April 1971. The Certificate will be granted to a student who successfully completes a two year course of full time training at one of the Council's three Law Schools in Jamaica, Trinidad or The Bahamas. The students will be taught by a system of practical instruction designed to give training in the basic and essential skills of the practicing lawyer. Entry into a Law School will normally be granted to any applicant holding The U.W.I. LLB degree. Students who hold law degrees from other universities are required to sit an entrance examination which is held in July of each year. The deadline for applications to the Law Schools is January 31 of the proposed year of study. Application forms are obtainable from the Faculty of Law or from either of the three Law Schools at the addresses below:

## Norman Manley Law School

P.O. Box 231

Mona Campus

Kingston 7

JAMAICA

## The Eugene Dupuch Law School

P.O. Box SS-6394

Nassau

THE BAHAMAS

## Hugh Wooding Law School

P.O. Box 323

Tunapuna Post Office

TRINIDAD &amp; TOBAGO

Holders of a Certificate of Legal Education will be regarded by all Governments in the West Indies as having satisfied institutional and educational requirements for practice, but local legislation may add further requirements such as the  requirement  of  nationality,  which  must  be  satisfied  before  the  right  to practice is  granted  in  a  particular territory.

## THE RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF STUDENTS

## PREAMBLE

Rights  operate  within  a  system  of  fundamental  values.  Rights  and  privileges  go  hand  in  hand  with  their corresponding duties, obligations and responsibilities. Such are the principles that bind student membership in The University of the West Indies community with the fundamental values, rights and responsibilities of the University as a community.

The Code sets out the ground rules, considered consistent with the goals and well-being of the University, for the conduct of all students who belong to the University community. This Code of Students Rights and Responsibilities has been written to define and explain rights, obligations and responsibilities of students while they are members of The University of the West Indies community. It has been written cooperatively by students, faculty and staff.

The  Code  is  subject  to  and  limited  by  the  Laws  of  the  individual  Campus  Countries  and  the  Charter,  Statutes, Ordinances and Regulations of the University. In  addition it seeks to set out the procedures in place to review incidents of misconduct.

This Code is applicable to all registered students of The University of the West Indies, including those registered in joint programmes such as the joint UWI/UTech degree program.

The University accepts you as a responsible individual and accordingly requires that you make responsible decisions regarding  your  own  moral,  social  and  spiritual  behavior  and  the  success  of  the  University  as  an  educational institution. That is the basis of your membership of the University Community. This code is thus intended to help ensure mutual respect for your rights and the rights of others and to support an environment conducive to personal and intellectual growth. In furtherance of those objectives, you are required to accept the responsibilities indicated below:

- 1. CIVIL STATUTES  You retain your RIGHTS as an individual when you become a member of the University, including the right of freedom of conscience and of lawful assembly and association. You have the corresponding RESPONSIBILITY to abide by the laws of the land in addition to the University's own laws and norms. Action by civil authorities with regard to misconduct may not satisfy the University's disciplinary procedures, in which case  the  University  reserves  the  right  to  take  further  action,  in  the  interest  of  the  University  community. Disciplinary action on the part of the University does not preclude or supersede criminal or civil action arising from misconduct.
- 2. ACADEMIC RESPONSIBILITY  You have a RIGHT to the resources necessary for the attainment of your learning objectives,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  timely,  accurate  and  reliable  information  on  all  academic  matters affecting students; to access information on campus services and facilities without undue difficulty; to adequate instruction; to express opinion on the performance of lecturers and the quality of teaching; to receive accurate information about examination procedures; to be fairly examined; to receive timely examination review and results; and to receive as far as is practicable explanations of reasons for failure in order to be able to plan and accomplish  your  educational  and  career\  objectives.  You  are  equally  RESPONSIBLE  for  your  own  learning throughout your academic career and for adhering to the schedule of dates and academic and non-academic regulations as stated in the Undergraduate and Graduate Calendars.
- 3. SECURITY  You  have  a  RIGHT  to  adequate  and  reasonable  security.  You  have  the  corresponding RESPONSIBILITY not to engage in behavior which will endanger your own safety or that of other persons, nor should you engage in an activity or a behavior which is likely to disturb other persons in the enjoyment of their rights or in their pursuit of knowledge.
- 4. SAFETY  You have a RIGHT to be informed of the potential dangers of chemicals, equipment and other materials which are in use as part of your course of study, and to be advised of methods to protect yourself from these dangers. You have a RESPONSIBILITY to implement action to protect yourself from these potential dangers.
- 5. FACILITIES AND PROPERTY  You have a RIGHT to the use of University facilities for lawful assembly and association. You have the corresponding RESPONSIBILITY:
- (a) to respect posted hours and limits on unauthorized entry where such conditions exist;
- (b) not to destroy, tamper with, deface, monopolize University property or unlawfully gain access to buildings and other facilities of the University, or remove or possess property not your own, including Library materials, equipment, computing facilities, and telephones;
- (c) not to tamper with fire protection equipment; and
- (d) to confine smoking only to areas designated for that purpose.
- 6. PERMITS AND IDENTIFICATION  You have a RIGHT, upon payment of the required fees, such as those for caution  money  and  ID  photographs,  of  access  to  certain  special  services  as  a  member  of  the  University community. You have the corresponding RESPONSIBILITY not to acquire University identification that is stolen, cancelled, lost, false or altered, or to allow other persons to use your lD cards or permits.
- 7. GROUNDS  You have a RIGHT to the use of the University grounds. You have the corresponding RESPONSIBILITY to observe the following limitations:
- (a) Motor  Vehicles  -  Motor  vehicles  are  subject  to  the  posted  rules  on  the  campuses  and  other  University property. The University reserves the right to impose fines if rules regarding vehicular traffic are not strictly observed.
- (b) Littering - all garbage must be disposed of in the appropriate receptacles to preserve and maintain a clean environment.
- 8. FREEDOM OF CONSCIENCE AND EXPRESSION  You have a RIGHT of freedom of conscience and of expression. You have the corresponding RESPONSIBILITY not to engage in an activity or a behavior which shows disrespect for the rights of others or is likely to deprive others of their freedoms.
- 9. DISCRIMINATION  You  have  a  RIGHT  to  be  treated  without  discrimination  on  the  basis  of  race,  creed, nationality, sex, disability or place of origin. You have the corresponding RESPONSIBILITY to treat all members of the University community with respect.
- 10. INTERFERENCE, HARASSMENT, DISRUPTIONS  You have a RIGHT to an environment that is safe and free from  harassment.  You  have  the  corresponding  RESPONSIBILITY  to  avoid  engaging  in  any  activity,  such  as fighting, which is likely to cause personal injury, in interference in any class or function, in intimidation and in harassment of any nature including, but not limited to, sexual harassment. The use of University equipment, computing  facilities,  telephone,  mail,  poster  displays,  and  other  internal  communications  systems  or  other facility to convey nuisance, obscene, or otherwise objectionable messages, is prohibited.
- 11. ALCOHOL, WEAPONS AND DRUGS  You  have  a  DUTY  to  abide  by  the  laws  of  the  land  pertaining  to  the possession and/or use of alcohol, weapons and illegal drugs.
- 12. VISITORS  You have a RIGHT to have visitors on campus in accordance with existing Hall Rules and Regulations. You have the corresponding RESPONSIBILITY to ensure that your guests abide by the University's laws and norms, and in all other respects comply with or obey any request or direction given by a duly authorized officer of the University.

## TEACHING AND EXAMINATION

## TEACHING ARRANGEMENTS

The course of study provided on all campuses will be designed for full-time and part-time students. Thus, students will be required to attend classes during the day, although some may take place in the evening. Law studies, in addition, require frequent and intensive use of the Law Library for reference to the basic source materials, such as law reports, statutes and texts. The program of work provided will involve the preparation of written and oral opinions which call for concentrated library work at regular intervals.

## LECTURES AND TUTORIALS

Teaching in law subjects will in most of the courses in Part I and Part II take the form of lectures and tutorials. Tutorials are arranged on a small-group basis. In these classes, the student will be expected to develop the techniques of argument and presentation of cases and to produce essays, opinions and small project work under tutorial guidance. The tutorial is a very important aspect of the teaching program in the Faculty, and attendance at tutorials is compulsory.

## CASEBOOK METHOD

The student will be encouraged to learn the art of legal reasoning by use of the case-book method. This involves the preparatory reading of selected materials, followed by class discussion designed to deduce the legal rules inherent in the materials and their use and limits in future situations.

## SEMINARS

In  the  advanced  courses,  teaching  may  be  conducted  by  means  of  seminars.  This  involves  the preparatory reading of selected materials and the use of this to analyze and discuss a presentation based on these materials.

## MOOTS

With  Faculty  encouragement,  the  students'  Law  Society  has  organized  a  program  of  mooting.  This involves the preparation and presentation of argument and counter-argument on points of law in a simulated court situation. Success lies not in the winning of the case but in the demonstration of legal skills  in  making  the  best  argument  from  the  materials  available.  Opportunities  also  exist  for  the participation in International competitions, e.g. the Price Media Law Moot Court Competition and the Caribbean Court of Justice Moot subject to the availability of funds.

## BOOK LISTS

Book lists will be issued separately for each course and detailed reading and work sheets will be made available from time to time during the session. Course books may also be prepared and sold to students at cost.

## FACULTY ADVISORS

Students are each assigned to a Faculty Advisor for the duration of their undergraduate career in the Faculty. The Advisor will give help and advice on matters of an academic nature if such advice is sought. The Faculty Advisor is to be regarded by students as an important Faculty resource.

## EXAMINATIONS

Examinations are normally held at the end of each Semester. In some courses, however, examinations may take the form of essays submitted during the Semester, together with an examination at the end of a Semester, or solely of an extended research paper, submitted during the course of the academic year, as in the Independent Research Paper Course.

## MINOR IN LAW

The Minor in Law allows all candidates reading majors in other disciplines to augment their studies with law,  contributing more  rounded  graduates.  In  addition,  courses  in  law  will  be  especially  useful  to candidates  contemplating  a  career  in  government  or  commerce.  Candidates  who  have  acquired  the Minor in Law, and who later contemplate a career in law, will be able to complete the LL.B. degree in a shorter time, having already acquired a number of the required LLB credits in the mix-degree. The Minor in Law programme requires that candidates complete nine (9) credits in introductory law and legal methods, six (6) credits from a restricted list of PART 2 LLB courses, and six (6) additional credits from courses not already read from the lists of PART 2 and PART 3 LLB courses.  The final selection of courses from PART 2 and PART 3 requires consultation and approval by the Faculty of Law.

## Minimum Number of Credits for Minor in Law:

PART 1

- 9 credits (from 2 Level I courses)

PART 2

- 6 credits (from 2 of 4 Level II courses)

PART 3 - 9 credits (any 3 Level II or III courses)

## DEFINITION OF PLAGIARISM

- 2. In these Regulations, 'plagiarism' means the unacknowledged and unjustified use of the words, ideas or creations of another, including unjustified unacknowledged quotation and unjustified unattributed borrowing;

- 3. What may otherwise  meet  the  definition  of  plagiarism  may  be  justified  for  the  purposes  of Regulation 2 where the particular unacknowledged use of the words, ideas and creations of another is by the standards of the relevant academic discipline a function of part or all of the object of the work for evaluation whether or not for credit, for example:
-  The unacknowledged use is required for conformity with presentation standards;
-  The  task  set  or  undertaken  is  one  of  translation  of  the  work  of  another  into  a  different language or format;
-  The  task  set  or  undertaken  requires  producing  a  result  by  teamwork  for  joint  credit regardless of the level of individual contribution;
-  The task set or undertaken requires extensive adaptation of models within a time period of such brevity as to exclude extensive attribution;
-  The task set or undertaken requires the use of an artificial language, such as is the case with computer programming, where the use of unoriginal verbal formulae is essential.
- 4. It is not a justification under Regulations 2 and 3 for the unacknowledged use of the words, ideas and creations of another that the user enjoys the right of use of those words, ideas and creations as a matter of intellectual property.
