## PLAGIARISM REGULATIONS

Effective academic year 2011-2012

## Application of these Regulations

- 1. These Regulations apply to the presentation of work by a student for evaluation, whether or not for credit, but do not apply to invigilated written examinations.

## Definition of plagiarism

- 2. In  these  Regulations,  'plagiarism'  means  the  unacknowledged  and unjustified use of the words, ideas or creations of another, including unjustified  unacknowledged  quotation  and  unjustified  unattributed borrowing;
- 'Level  1  plagiarism'  means  plagiarism  which  does  not  meet  the definition of Level 2 plagiarism;

'Level 2 plagiarism' means plagiarism undertaken with the intention of passing off as original work by the plagiariser work done by another person or persons.

- 3. What may otherwise meet the definition of plagiarism may be justified for the purposes of Regulation 2 where the particular unacknowledged use of the words, ideas and creations of another is by the standards of the relevant academic discipline a function of part or all of the object of the work for evaluation whether or not for credit, for example:
- (a) The unacknowledged use is required for conformity with presentation standards;
- (b) The  task  set  or  undertaken  is  one  of  translation  of  the  work  of another into a different language or format;
- (c) The  task set or undertaken  requires  producing  a  result  by teamwork  for  joint  credit  regardless  of  the  level  of  individual contribution;
- (d) The  task  set  or  undertaken  requires  extensive  adaptation  of models within a time period of such brevity as to exclude extensive attribution;
- (e) The  task  set  or  undertaken  requires  the  use  of  an  artificial language, such as is the case with computer programming, where the use of unoriginal verbal formulae is essential.

- 4. It is not a justification under Regulations 2 and 3 for the unacknowledged use of the words, ideas and creations of another that the user enjoys the right of use of those words, ideas and creations as a matter of intellectual property.

## Other definitions

- 5. In these Regulations, 'Chair' or means the Chair of the relevant Campus Committee  on  Examinations;  'Examination  Regulations'  means  the Examination  and  other  forms  of  Assessment  Regulations  for  First Degrees Associate Degrees Diplomas and Certificates of the University; 'set of facts' means a fact or combination of facts.

## Evidence of plagiarism

- 6. In order to constitute evidence of plagiarism under these Regulations, there must be identified as a minimum the passage or passages in the student's work which are considered to have been plagiarised and the passage or passages from which the passages in the student's work are considered to have been derived.

## Student certification

- 7. When a student submits for examination work under Regulation 1, the student shall sign a statement, in such form as the Campus Registrar may prescribe,  that  as  far  as  possible  the  work  submitted  is  free  of plagiarism including unattributed quotation or paraphrase of the work of another except where justified under Regulation 3.
- 8. Quotation or paraphrase is attributed for the purpose of Regulation 7 if the writer has indicated that the work is not the writer's own, even if the source is not identified.
- 9. Accurate certification  under  Regulation  7  is  not  conclusive  as  to  the absence of plagiarism under these Regulations. Absence of certification does  not  prohibit  the  University  from  proceeding  with  a  charge  of plagiarism.

## Electronic vetting for plagiarism

- 10. The Campus Registrar may authorise or direct with the consent of the student  that  work  submitted  under  Regulation  7  be  subjected  to electronic scrutiny in order to verify its freedom from plagiarism before being submitted to the Examiners. The results of the electronic scrutiny

shall be submitted to the Dean and the Head of Department as well as to the Examiners, but the results of such electronic scrutiny although capable,  where  the  requirements  of  Regulation  6  are  satisfied,  of constituting evidence under these Regulations, are not thereby conclusive of any question as to whether or not plagiarism exists.

- 11. Where a Dean or Head of Department considers that the procedure under Regulation 10 discloses evidence of plagiarism, the Dean or Head of Department, as the case may be, shall:
- (a) where the procedure is considered to disclose evidence of Level 2 plagiarism,  report  the  matter  to  the  Campus  Registrar  under Regulation 15(a); or
- (b) where the procedure is considered to disclose evidence of Level 1 plagiarism, refer the matter to the Examiners for their consideration as a charge of Level 1 plagiarism under Regulation 12.

## Level 1 plagiarism

- 12. In work submitted for examination where the Examiner is satisfied that Level 1 plagiarism has been committed, he shall levy a penalty for the Level 1 plagiarism charged in the form of a reduction in the marks which would have otherwise been awarded.

## Level 2 plagiarism

- 13. Where an Examiner has evidence of Level 2 plagiarism in the material being  examined,  that  Examiner  must  report  it  to  the  Head  of Department or the Dean and may at any time provide the Registrar with a copy of that report.
- 14. Where any other person who in the course of duty sees material being examined that has evidence of Level 2 plagiarism that other person may report it to the Head of Department or the Dean and may at any time report it to the Campus Registrar who shall take such action as may be appropriate.
- 15. Where  a  Dean  or  Head  of  Department  receives  a  report  under Regulation 13, the Dean or Head of Department, as the case may be, shall:

- (a) Where in concurrence with the report's identification of  evidence of Level 2 plagiarism, report the matter to the Campus Registrar; or
- (b) Where  not concurring in the identification of evidence of plagiarism, reply to the Examiner declining to proceed further on the Examiner's report; or
- (c) Where concluding that there is evidence of Level 1 plagiarism, reply to the Examiner indicating that conclusion and proceed as under Regulation 12.
- 16. Where a report is made to the Campus Registrar under Regulation 15(a) or Regulation 17, the Campus Registrar shall lay a charge and refer the matter to the Campus Committee on Examinations.
- 17. Where the Campus Registrar receives a report from the Examiner or any  other  person,  the  Campus  Registrar  shall  refer  the  matter  to  a senior academic  to  determine  evidence  to  ground  a  charge  of plagiarism  and  where  there  is  a  ground,  the  Campus  Registrar  shall proceed as under Regulation 16.
- 18. Where  the  matter  has  been  referred  to  the  Campus  Committee  on Examinations pursuant to Regulation 16, the proceedings under these Regulations prevail, subject to Regulation 19, over any other disciplinary proceedings against the student based on the same facts and,  without  prejudice  to  Regulation  24,  any  other  such  disciplinary proceedings must be stayed, subject to being reopened.
- 19. Where other disciplinary  proceedings  based  on  the  same  facts  have been  completed  or  have  reached  the  stage  of  a  hearing,  whichever comes first, any proceedings under these Regulations based on a charge of Level 2 plagiarism shall be terminated.

20.

- (a) If the Campus Committee on Examinations is satisfied, after holding a hearing, that the student has committed Level 2 plagiarism, it shall in making  a  determination  on  the  severity  of  the  penalty  take  into consideration:
- i. the circumstances of the particular case;
- ii. the seniority of the student; and
- iii. whether  this  is  the  first  or  a  repeated  incidence  of  Level  2 plagiarism.

- (b) Where  a  recommendation  is  made  to  fail  the  student,  the  Campus Committee on Examinations shall make that recommendation to the Campus  Registrar  who  shall  refer  it  to  the  Academic  Board  for  the student to be failed.
- 21. Academic Board may also, if the Campus Committee on Examinations so recommends after being satisfied that the student has committed Level 2 plagiarism, exclude the student from all further examinations of the University for such period as it may determine.
- 22. Academic Board may also, if the Campus Committee on Examinations so recommends after being satisfied that the student has committed Level 2 plagiarism, dismiss the candidate from the University.

## Clearance on a charge of Level 2 plagiarism

23.

- A determination of the Campus Committee on Examinations that Level 2  plagiarism  has  not  been  found  will  be  reported  to  the  Campus Registrar who shall refer it to the appropriate authority and notify the student.  Where  the  Committee  has  not  identified  Level  2  but  has identified Level 1, it shall be reported to the Campus Registrar who shall refer it to the Examiner.

## Level 2 plagiarism: Appeal to the Senate

- 24. A student may appeal to the Senate from any decision of the Campus Committee on Examinations Regulations 20 and 21 and of Academic Board under Regulation 22.

## Delegation by Dean or Head of Department

- 25. The Dean or Head of Department, as the case may be, may generally or in  a  particular  instance  delegate  that  officer's  functions  under  these Regulations.

## Examiner's conflict of interest disqualification

- 26. Any person who has at any time been an Examiner of work in relation which an issue of plagiarism is being considered under these Regulations must withdraw from performing any functions under these Regulations other than those of supervisor and Examiner.
