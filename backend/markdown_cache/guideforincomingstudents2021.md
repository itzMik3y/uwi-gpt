Visa should  be  obtained  at  a  Jamaican  Consulate  or  Embassy  prior  to your arrival in the island.

PRE-ARRIVAL INFORMATION FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS

Please  ensure  that  you  have  the  original  letter  of acceptance from us as you will be landed initially as a visitor to the island but thereafter you will have to apply  for  your  status  to  be  changed  to  that  of 'student'.

The credits received from all previously approved courses taken on UWI's International Exchange Programme will be treated as UWI credits and will apply towards  graduation requirements.

Registered students are encouraged to spend a semester or a year (except the final semester of the final year) at any one of our other two Campuses,  Cave  Hill,  Barbados  or  St.  Augustine, Trinidad.  Tuition  fees  are  paid  to  the  home  UWI Campus  and  miscellaneous  fees  to  the  UWI  host  Campus.  However,  the  student  is  responsible  for  living, transportation and other expenses. The credits received from all previously approved courses taken on UWI's Inter-Regional  Exchange  Programme  will  be  treated  exactly  as  UWI  courses  and  will  apply  towards  your graduation requirement.
