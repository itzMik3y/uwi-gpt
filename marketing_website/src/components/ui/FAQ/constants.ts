  {
    question: 'What technologies power UWI-GPT?',
    answer:
      'UWI-GPT uses a modern stack: React for the front-end, FastAPI for backend services, PostgreSQL for session management, and an embedded Quran semantic search vector space to support intelligent responses. It also incorporates advanced NLP techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), BM25, and MMR reranking.',

    question: 'How is my data handled when using UWI-GPT?',
    answer:
      'Student credentials are used solely to access necessary university systems and are never stored. UWI-GPT is designed to comply with UWIâ€™s security and privacy standards.',
