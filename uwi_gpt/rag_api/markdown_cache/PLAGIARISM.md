## Application of these Regulations

- 1 These Regulations apply to the presentation of work by a student for evaluation, whether or not for credit, but do not apply to invigilated written examinations.

## Definition of plagiarism

- 2 In these Regulations,
- 'plagiarism' means the unacknowledged and unjustified use of the words, ideas or creations of another, including unjustified unacknowledged quotation and unjustified unattributed borrowing;
- 'Level 1 plagiarism' means plagiarism which does not meet the definition of Level 2 plagiarism;
- 'Level 2 plagiarism' means plagiarism undertaken with the intention of passing off as original work by the plagiariser work done by another person or persons.
- 3 What may otherwise meet the definition of plagiarism may be justified for the purposes of Regulation 2 where the particular unacknowledged use of the words, ideas and creations of another is by the standards of the relevant academic discipline a function of part or all of the object of the work for evaluation whether or not  for credit, for example:
- a. The unacknowledged use is required for conformity with presentation standards;
- b. The task set or undertaken is one of translation of the work of another into a different language or format;
- c. The task set or undertaken requires producing a result by teamwork for joint credit regardless of the level of individual contribution;
- d. The task set or undertaken requires extensive adaptation of models within a time period of such brevity as to exclude extensive attribution;
- e. The task set or undertaken requires the use of an artificial language, such as is the case with computer programming, where the use of unoriginal verbal formulae is essential.

- 4 It is not a justification under Regulations 2 and 3 for the unacknowledged use of the words, ideas and creations of another that the user enjoys the right of use of those words, ideas and creations as a matter of intellectual property.

## Other definitions

- 5 In these Regulations,
- 'Chairman' means the Chairman of the relevant Campus Committee on Examinations;
- 'Examination Regulations' means the Examination and other forms of Assessment Regulations for First Degrees Associate Degrees Diplomas and Certificates of the University;
- 'set of facts' means a fact or combination of facts.

## Evidence of plagiarism

- 6 In  order  to  constitute  evidence  of  plagiarism  under  these  Regulations,  there shall be identified as a minimum the passage or passages in the student's work which  are  considered  to  have  been  plagiarised  and  the  passage  or  passages from which the passages in the student's work are considered to  have  been taken.

## Student Statement on Plagiarism

- 7 When a student submits for examination work under Regulation 1, the student shall sign a statement, in such form as the Campus Registrar may prescribe, that  as  far  as  possible  the  work  submitted  is  free  of  plagiarism  including unattributed  quotation  or  paraphrase  of  the  work  of  another  except  where justified under Regulation 3.
- 8 Quotation or  paraphrase  is  attributed  for  the  purpose  of  Regulation  7  if  the writer  has  indicated  using  conventions  appropriate  to  the  discipline  that  the work is not the writer's own.
- 9 The University is not prohibited from proceeding with a charge of plagiarism where there is no statement as prescribed under Regulation 7.

## Electronic vetting for plagiarism

- 10 The results of any electronic vetting although capable, where the requirements of Regulation 7 are satisfied, of constituting evidence under these Regulations, are not thereby conclusive of any question as to whether or not plagiarism exists.

## Level 1 plagiarism

- 11 In work submitted for examination where the Examiner is satisfied that Level 1 plagiarism has been committed, he/she shall penalise the student by reducing the mark which would have otherwise been awarded taking into account any relevant Faculty regulations.

## Level 2 plagiarism

- 12 Where an examiner has evidence of Level 2 plagiarism in the material  being examined, that examiner shall report it to the Head of Department or the Dean and may at any time provide the Registrar with a copy of that report. In cases where the examiner and the Dean are one and the same, the report shall be referred to the Head of the Department and also to the Campus Registrar.
- 13 Where any other person who in the course of duty sees material being examined which he or she believes is evidence of Level 2 plagiarism that other person may report it to the Head of Department or the Dean and may at any time report it to the Campus Registrar who shall take such action as may be appropriate.
- 14       Where a Dean or Head of Department receives a report either under Regulation 12 or 13,
- the Dean or Head of Department, as the case may be, shall
- a. where in concurrence with the report's identification of evidence of Level 2 plagiarism, report the matter to the Campus Registrar; or
- b. where not concurring in the identification of evidence of plagiarism, reply to the examiner declining to proceed further on the report; or
- c. where concluding that there is evidence of Level 1 plagiarism, reply to the examiner indicating that conclusion and the Examiner shall proceed as under Regulation 11.
- 15 Where a report is made to the Campus Registrar under Regulation 14a or 16, the Campus Registrar shall lay a charge and refer the matter to the Campus Committee on Examinations.
- 16     Where the Campus Registrar receives a report alleging Level 2 plagiarism from the  Examiner or  any other person except the Dean or  Head of  Department, the Campus Registrar shall refer the matter to a senior academic to determine whether there  is  sufficient  evidence  to  ground  a  charge  of  plagiarism  and  where  such evidence is found, the Campus Registrar shall proceed as under Regulation 15.
- 17 Where the matter has been referred to the Campus Committee on Examinations pursuant to Regulation 15, the proceedings under these Regulations prevail, over any  other  disciplinary  proceedings  within  the  University  initiated  against  the student based on the same facts and, without prejudice to Regulation 21, any other such disciplinary proceedings shall be stayed, subject to being reopened.
- 18    If the Campus Committee on Examinations is satisfied, after holding a hearing, that the student  has committed Level 2 plagiarism, it shall in making a determination on the severity of the penalty take into consideration:
- a. the circumstances of the particular case;
- b. the seniority of the student; and
- c) whether this is the first or a repeated incidence of Level 2 plagiarism.
- 19 Where the Campus Committee is of the view that the appropriate penalty for an offence of Level 2 plagiarism is for the student to be:

- (i) awarded a fail mark;
- (ii) excluded from some or all further examinations of the University for such period as it may determine;
- (iii) be dismissed from the University,
- it shall make such recommendation to the Academic Board.

## Clearance on a charge of Level 2 plagiarism

- 20 A determination of the Campus Committee on Examinations that Level 2 plagiarism has not been found will be reported to the Campus Registrar who shall refer it to the Examiner and notify the student.   Where the Committee has not identified Level 2 but has identified Level 1, it shall be reported to the Campus Registrar who shall refer it to the examiner.

## Level 2 plagiarism: Appeal to the Senate

- 21 A student may appeal to the Senate from any decision against him or her on a charge of plagiarism made by Academic Board.

## Delegation by Dean or Head of Department

- 22 The  Dean  or  Head  of  Department,  as  the  case  may  be,  may  generally  or  in  a particular instance delegate that officer's functions under these Regulations.

## Conflict of interest disqualification

- 23 Any person who has at any time been an examiner of work or been involved in procedures for laying charges in relation to which an issue of plagiarism is being considered under these Regulations shall withdraw from performing any functions under these Regulations other than those of supervisor and examiner.
