Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Policy The UWI Mona Campus, July 2023

## 1. PREAMBLE

## 1.1. The University of the West Indies' Commitments to Equity, Diversity and Inclusion

The University of the West Indies (The UWI) recognizes the importance of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (ED&amp;I). These principles are among the organisation's core values and play a central role in the Triple A Strategy, 2017-2022 ; they are also present in the Statement of Ethical Principles and Code of Conduct (2018/2019) and guide the institution towards creating "greater and more affordable access to reduce social inequality in the region." 1 These ED&amp;I principles set the norm for "a fair and just environment" in which all employees of The UWI "are able to access opportunities that allow for full participation." 2

The UWI vouches to provide a study and work environment which must be "inclusive of and affirm the dignity of all persons regardless of race, socio-economic status, age, sex, gender identity and expression, physical and mental ability, sexual orientation, family or marital status, national origin, language, political or religious persuasion, health status, and other characteristics that make its constituents unique." 3 By placing these principles upfront and making the protection of these characteristics non-negotiable, The UWI shows  its commitment to equity, diversity and inclusion.  In its decision to create an Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Policy ("the ED&amp;I Policy "), it sets normative guidelines for decision making.

The ED&amp;I Policy is focused on Higher Education (HE) as prepared, designed and delivered by The UWI. The Policy applies across different organisational domains: ranging from the work force levels, across the traditionally separated groups of employees-(senior) management, administrative personnel, faculty, technical and service staff-to the level of customers and stakeholders (students and alumni) as well as products (curricula, programmes and projects). Applied to management and administration, the ED&amp;I Policy could, for instance, lead to the creation of leadership opportunities for historically under-represented groups, e.g.

## Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Policy The UWI Mona Campus, July 2023

women. When focused on faculty, it could identify unconscious bias and create inclusive classrooms; equitable employment could include transparent, competitive, open processes, fair recruitment, performance evaluations, unbiased promotions and appointment based on merit. 3

## 1.2. Complex Concepts

The concepts of equity, diversity and inclusion are complex; they can be driven and shaped by fluctuating internal and external factors which may affect The UWI. Examples are: increased financial pressures; tighter accreditation requirements; expanding competition from other Higher Education Institutions (HEIs); or, rising customers' expectations. In the 80s, some of the external drivers of greater access for students led to The UWI's efforts of being more responsive to the needs of the 'non-campus countries' by establishing multiple open campus locations in the region. 4 Or, in the mid-90s, when the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) triggered a wave of foreign off-shore universities entering the Caribbean, and The UWI was prompted to widen its access-growing from a student enrollment at the Mona Campus of 7,000 in the early 90s to over 19,000 in 2019, producing not only greater numbers, but also increasing diversity.

With greater diversity, new needs will exist, requiring tailored strategies and approaches to be addressed adequately. This could be especially the case for students coming from "underserved" populations, who earlier in life, may have faced limited access to pre-natal and other care; lack of good nutrition; no exposure to quality teachers, no access to after school classes; and overcrowded housing-factors, which could influence their later academic performance. 5

As The UWI expands the use of online teaching and learning platforms and applications, students and staff with disabilities, other underserved and marginalised communities could be excluded because of the lack of access to the appropriate learning tools and resources.  The absence of smart devices, internet connectivity, and associated technologies could affect access.

## Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Policy The UWI Mona Campus, July 2023

In addition, The UWI must ensure that the diversity in learning styles is reflected in the delivery of all its courses and programmes and that its technologies support diversity and inclusion.

The primary aim of 'Inclusion' is to ensure fairness to all employees of The UWI, regardless of personal differences. Both concepts-diversity as well as inclusion-must be operationalised concurrently: "Access without support is not opportunity." 6

## 2. RATIONALE FOR THE EQUITY, DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION POLICY

## 2.1. The UWI 's Principles, Values and Aspirations

- 2.1.1. The UWI's ambition, expressed in its vision of becoming an excellent globallyoriented university requires staff and students to be familiar and comfortable with equity, diversity and inclusion. These principles are essential to operating internationally, as the institution enhances its global footprint and prepares graduates for professional employment, both regionally and internationally.
- 2.1.2. Similarly, with 'diversity' as one of the core values a greater emphasis on The UWI as an international university will lead to the acquisition of more international staff. The Policy will utilise holistic approaches to foster culturally competent practices and interactions, continuously facilitating a mental opening up towards differences.
- 2.1.3.  With an ED&amp;I Policy , The UWI will have a greater chance to achieve its accreditation requirements.
- 2.1.4. The UWI's Triple A Strategy 's reference to "Education for All"  will be reinforced 8 as it commits itself to reduce inequalities treating education as a key element in development. 7  This will also promote The UWI as being a socially accountable institution.

## Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Policy The UWI Mona Campus, July 2023

## 2.2. Changing Demographics and New Cultures in Student Populations

- 2.2.1. A greater influx of students from different social and economic background begs for closer attention to their specific needs and challenges. Pro-active identification of possible gaps in students' feelings of comfort and belonging are key characteristics of engagement and inclusion.
- 2.2.2. Students born between 1981-1996, or Millennials, also called Generation Y, are the earliest adopters of social media and internet technology. They multi-task, use instant messaging and a wide range of communication modes, channels and platforms. 8 Anecdotal evidence suggests that they, and the upcoming Generation Z (born in 1997 and later), have been, and will be, a challenge for most teaching staff in the future. Thus, the ED&amp;I Policy would also facilitate any comprehension gaps regarding viewpoints, expectations and the like, between students and teaching faculty.
- 2.2.3. International students attending The UWI will experience explicit values of respect and dignity for all cultures, fed by an inclusive environment at The UWI.

## 2.3. Inclusion of Alumni

The UWI's alumni population-many of which are 'Young Alumni'-is a key stakeholder. However, graduates are not engaged consistently by the campus(es), resulting in missed opportunities for involvement of this valuable resource. The Policy will serve to better educate and guide graduates as they interact and engage with students, faculty and staff.

## 2.4. Caring for The UWI's Employees

Surveys among the Mona Campus population in previous years show dissatisfaction among parts of The UWI Mona staff, lacking a sense of engagement and not feeling psychologically safe and fair. An inclusive climate expects respect and justice for all, in which those who are part of the organisation feel valued for who they are and what they do, and have a general sense of belonging.

## Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Policy The UWI Mona Campus, July 2023

## 2.5. Preparing for Partnership and Changing the Regional Landscape

- 2.5.1. Other high-ranking universities across the globe currently may find The UWI's lack of an ED&amp;I Policy an obstacle for affiliations or Memoranda of Understanding (MoU). This reservation would change when The UWI successfully implements its ED&amp;I Policy .
- 2.5.2. The UWI has always underlined its ambition to be relevant for the societies it serves and be the region's leader in education. Experiences in the USA, Europe, South Africa, and Latin America have shown that HEIs, in omitting their organisation's exclusionary norms, attitudes, practices and behaviours, can become the lead agents, or role model for their societies to omit theirs. 9
- 2.5.3. The UWI will have a competitive advantage in the Caribbean if it decides to take the lead among HEIs on developing equity, diversity and inclusion.

## 2.6. Diversity and Inclusion in Nowadays Businesses

The benefits of diversity for the organisation itself-the business case- includes the fact that "diversity broadens the talent pool, allowing organisations to tap into new talent sources and broader ranges of skills," which make the students "better able to meet the needs of the growing global marketplace and attract a wider range of customers." 1011 Gaining the benefits of a diverse workforce requires an inclusive organisational culture. 12

- 2.7. The Legislative and Policy Framework of the Country in Which the Campus is Located The Policy will meet the obligations of national legislation and policies and help to prevent lawsuits related to non-compliance with these frameworks. (See Annex I for some of these policy frameworks).

## 2.8. International Conventions

The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights , the multilateral treaty which Jamaica ratified in 1976, states in article 13c that "Higher education shall be made equally accessible to all, on the basis of capacity, by every appropriate means, and

## Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Policy The UWI Mona Campus, July 2023

in particular by the progressive introduction of free education." The ED&amp;I Policy will ensure that access to education will be fair by recognising the specific backgrounds of under-served sub-populations and their particular needs.

## 2.9. Avoiding Contradictions

Thus far, The University of the West Indies has applied the principles of equity, diversity and inclusion in an ad hoc and indirect manner. Without normative guidelines for decision making, The UWI is likely to develop "must-do" routine solutions for institutional challenges, running the risk of contradicting the equity, diversity and inclusion pillars which support the organisation's vision and mission.  To avoid these contradictions, The UWI must ensure that the equity, diversity and inclusion principles will be operationalised consistently and predictably, in all relevant practices and procedures, integrated into the workings of the organisation at all levels.

The Draft ED&amp;I Policy has been presented to the Mona Campus' Faculty Boards of the Faculty of Engineering; the Faculty of Humanities and Education; the Faculty of Law; the Faculty of Medical Sciences; the Faculty of Science and Technology; the Faculty of Social Sciences; as well as to the Campus Senior Management. The Policy has been shared with the Dean of the Faculty of Sports but not presented at this Faculty's regional meetings. All Faculty Boards, as well as the members of the Campus Senior Management meeting, formally "endorsed and indicated support for the establishment of a Campus-wide Policy on Equity, Diversity and Inclusion." The Faculty of Social Sciences suggested several changes and additions which have been addressed in the final Draft ED&amp;I Policy .

The introduction of a campus-wide ED&amp;I Policy , is a timely and necessary step, applying to all agents that relate with The University of the West Indies, Mona Campus. The principles of ED&amp;I must not be multi-interpretable but should be based on The UWI's core values, vision and mission.

## Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Policy The UWI Mona Campus, July 2023

## 3. DEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS OF CONCEPTS

Equity (social): Equity may be understood as the demonstration of fairness to all employees of The UWI ensuring that, regardless of personal differences, there is access and opportunities to the full range of programmes and services of the institution (see Annex II for an illustration on the difference between Equity and Equality).

Diversity : The condition or quality of being different or varied. 13 In the context of this ED&amp;I Policy , diversity refers to the 'recognition, valuing and harnessing of differences' (Kim, 2008) 14 , expressed or unexpressed, among staff, students or visitors.

Inclusion (also named social inclusion): Inclusion is a relational concept, which, when applied to an organisational context, puts the practice of diversity into action by creating an environment of engagement, respect, fairness, psychological safety and trust for all.

## 4. PURPOSE, AIMS AND JURISDICTION

- 4.1. Purpose of the Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Policy

The University of the West Indies has adopted equity, diversity and inclusion as some of its core values. In this context, the purpose of this ED&amp;I Policy is to:

- (i) guarantee that the opportunities The UWI provides for learning, personal development and employment are made available on a non-discriminating basis;
- (ii) ensure that differences in characteristics, perspectives and ideas among persons are valued and accorded respect in all aspects of university life - recognising that diversity is a fundamental characteristic of the human condition that is both valuable and necessary;  (iii) insist on an environment in which all individuals are treated with dignity and respect, providing a safe, supportive and welcoming environment for all. Where there are breaches in the ED&amp;I Policy The UWI vows to act swiftly.

## Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Policy The UWI Mona Campus, July 2023

## 4.2. Aims

The UWI seeks, through the ED&amp;I Policy , to promote diversity in all aspects of its day-to-day life and to integrate the principles of equal treatment and inclusiveness in the life of The UWI.

## 4.3. Jurisdiction

This ED&amp;I Policy is applicable to The University of the West Indies Mona Campus, including the Western Jamaica Campus (WJC), and off campus sites such as the Discovery Bay Marine Lab, and the Centre for Hotel and Tourism Management (The Bahamas). All persons within The UWI are required to comply with the terms of the ED&amp;I Policy .

## 4.4. Institutional Policies and Legal Framework

- 4.4.1. The ED&amp;I Policy shall serve as the framework for current and future UWI policies. Existing as well as new UWI policies with elements related to diversity, equity and inclusion shall be consistent with the ED&amp;I Policy (see Annex I).
- 4.4.2. Whereas The University of the West Indies, in the Code of Principles and Responsibilities for Students (2018), provides for the right of students to be treated without discrimination, the ED&amp;I Policy is based on the principles of non-discrimination, equity and equality with the view to ensuring an environment conducive to diversity and inclusion for The UWI Mona Campus.
- 4.4.3. The Statement of Code of Ethics for Academic and Senior Administrative Staff (1998) refers to misconduct such as sexual harassment, various types of discrimination and abuse of supervisory authority, citing Ordinance 8 with regard to procedures to be followed in cases of misconduct.
- 4.4.4. The ED&amp;I Policy complies with the national, regional and international laws that provide for the observance of human rights and the elimination of discrimination in all its forms (see Annex I).

## Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Policy The UWI Mona Campus, July 2023

and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) which is relevant to most of the countries, which The UWI protects. The ICESCR's characteristics are: colour; political or other opinion; social origin; birth or other status.
