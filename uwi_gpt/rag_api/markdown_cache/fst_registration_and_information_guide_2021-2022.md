## ADDITIONAL NOTES

- 1. All incoming Preliminary and Level I Biology students are required to register for the following course components:
- · One lecture stream (M1x); one laboratory stream (B0x); and one  tutorial stream (Txx) for each course (where 'x' denotes a numeral).
- 2. Where there is more than one stream for a course-component, one should select the  stream  that  best  fits  his/her  schedule.    However,  students  are  strongly advised  to  choose  the  same  streams  across  their  Preliminary/Level  I  BIOL courses  for  consistency.    Doing  so  also  helps  to  prevent  possible  timetable clashes as one progresses through the academic year.
- · For example: a student doing BIOL1017 (Sem I, 1 st  six weeks) may find the following streams compatible with their timetable:
- o Lecture (M11) -Tue 9-10 am; Thu 8-9 am; &amp; Fri 9-10 am.
- o Lab (B04) -Fri 10 am -1 pm &amp; 2-5 pm.
- o Tutorial (T13) -Thu 10-11 am.
- · The student is, therefore, advised to select the same streams for BIOL1018 (Sem I, 2 nd  six weeks), BIOL1262 (Sem II, 1 st  six weeks) and BIOL1263 (Sem II, 2 nd  six weeks).

Students pursuing a major or minor in the Department will also be required to do MATH1141 and MATH1185.

## ADDITIONAL NOTES

## 1. Schedule and Text

- · PHYS0411 &amp; PHYS0412 are 6-week courses.  PHYS0411 is held in the first 6 weeks and PHYS0412 in the latter 6 weeks.  The text for both courses is Physics by Cutnell and Johnson .
- · PHYS1411 &amp; PHYS1412 are 6-week courses.  PHYS1412 is held in the first 6 weeks and PHYS1411 in the latter 6 weeks.  The text for both courses is Fundamentals of Physics (extended edition) by Halliday, Resnick &amp; Walker OR Physics for Scientists and Engineers by Paul A. Tipler &amp; Gene Mosca .
- · There  are  also  PHYS1411  and  PHYS1412  Workbooks  available  online. Please bring the PHYS1412 Workbook, or the first few pages, to the first class.

## 2. Lab Manual

Available on OurVLE.

## 3. Lab Book

A lab notebook is required to write your reports (one per semester). This book is available at the University Bookshop.

## 4. Special notes on labs

- · Each PHYS04 lab is 3 hours in duration, while PHYS14 labs are 4 hours in duration. You are required to do one lab per week resulting in 6 labs for each course. For each course, students are required to register for one lab session. If, for example, the Monday lab session is chosen for PHYS0411, students are encouraged to register for the Monday lab for PHYS0412 as well.  This  will  mean  your  timetable  remains  unchanged  when  you  start PHYS0412 in the seventh week. Ensure that your lab does not clash with your other classes.
- · Manuals and lab books need to be purchased before labs start. Students are warned not to copy from lab books of past students. Copying will lead to expulsion from the course. Attendance at lab is compulsory .  Students who arrive late may not be granted access to the lab. If you are late because of a valid reason or missed a lab, speak with your lab supervisor in charge and the demonstrator, and arrange for a makeup session.

## 5. Tutorials

## FINANCIAL INFORMATION

## 37. Q. Are students required to pay fees to attend the UWI?

A: All students are expected to contribute to the cost of their education at The UWI. However, the Government of the contributing countries subsidizes the education  of  their  students.  Students  are  not  considered  as registered students until financial obligations have been met.

## 38. Q: How and where should I pay the fees?

A: Payments can be made through The UWI Bursary Cashier, Paymaster, Bill Express, UWI Online System, EDUCOM Credit Union, Jamaica National and National  Commercial  Bank  (Island  wide).    Payments  made  at  any  of  the payment  outlets  (Paymaster,  Bill  Express,  Jamaica  National  and  National Commercial Bank) are posted to the students' accounts the evening of t he same day payment is made.

## 39. Q:  Can I register for courses before payment?

A: Yes. However, payment of fees must be made within the stipulated time frame given by the University.

## 40. Q: How do I get Financial Clearance?

A: Financial Clearance is granted under the following conditions:

- a. All financial obligations to the University must be cleared for at least the first semester.
- b. If the  student  is  using  the  Students  Loan  Bureau  (SLB),  the miscellaneous fees and other fees must be paid by the student. In addition,  information  from  SLB  that  the  loan  process  has  been completed must be conveyed to the University.
- c. Students who are nationals of Trinidad and Tobago must pay their miscellaneous fees and submit a completed GATE form.

## 41. Q:   What are the fee payment options that are available to  students?

- A: In terms of fee payment, the following options are available:
- a. Students may pay for the academic year in one payment for tuition, miscellaneous  and  residence.  This  must  be  done  by  the  given deadline for the first semester of the relevant period.
- b. Students  may  pay  per  semester  for  tuition,  miscellaneous  and residence and this must be done by the stipulated deadline for each semester.

## 42. Q:  If I am paying my tuition fees via Student Loan Bureau (SLB) or other Loan Schemes, when do I get financial clearance?

- A: Students using the SLB will be given Financial Clearance and Registrar's Approval for one semester once the loan has been approved and the approval communicated to the University by the Student Loan Bureau. Students whose loan applications are pending, still being processed or awaiting the results of an appeal will not be able to complete their registration.

## 43. Q:   Can I pay for my miscellaneous fees and get my ID?

- A: Yes.  However,  students  are  encouraged  to  have  their  receipt  in  their possession.

## 44. Q: What happens if I do not pay my fees by the given deadline?

A: All payments are expected to be made by the deadline stipulated. If you realized  that  you  will  not  meet  the  stipulated  deadline,  seek  financial counselling at Student Administrative Services Section (SASS). Also, kindly note that once fees are outstanding for the current semester a late fine of 1% will be  applied  for  each  month  that  the  balance  remains  outstanding. Additionally,  once  the  balance  is  not  cleared  at  the  end  of  the  semester, students will not be able to access sections of the UWI system, in particular, the ability to register for semester 2.

## 45. Q. Please note the following:

A: If you have registered but cannot pay for the courses and are still within the period that you can 'web drop' courses, then 'web drop' all courses. If the time for dropping courses has passed and you are still registered for them, but are unable to pay, request a 'leave of absence' for that semester using the ASRM as soon as possible. The longer you wait the greater the possibility of a late penalty (academic board fine) being applied to your account. Even if you do not attend classes, you will be expected to pay for them. Failure to pay will also prevent you from registering for further courses.

## 46. Q: Does the University offer a payment plan?

- A: Yes. Payment plans are available on a per semester basis where students are granted a three-month period to clear all balances. The criteria are as follows:
- a. Payment plans are not provided for miscellaneous fees (which are non-refundable and must be paid in full) but are available for hall fees.
- b. 25% of the tuition fee must be paid at the time of application.
- c. There should be no prior monies owed to the University.

## 47. Q: Where do I go if I am faced with financial difficulties?

A. Please consult the Office of Student Financing, Guild of Students Office or Student Administrative Services Section (SASS).

## 48. Q: What are the policies governing the refund of fees to students?

- A: MISCELLANEOUS FEES ARE NON-REFUNDABLE , however a refund of fees may be considered in the following cases:
- a. Overpayment of fees.
- b. Where a donor has paid monies to UWI and authorized a refund to student.
- c. Where requests for the following have been approved:
- d. Leave of Absence (once requested within the stipulated time frame).
- e. Withdrawal (once requested within the stipulated time frame).
- f. Deferral of Entry.
- g. Reduction in the credit load (applicable to part-time students) .
- h. A student is not deemed to have been granted Deferral of Entry or Leave of Absence until written approval has been given by Academic Board Sub-Committee on Student Matters. However, for the purpose of refunds, the amount/percentage will be dependent on the date of application.

## 49. Q. Can I be refunded the tuition fee for the semester that I cancelled my enrolment?

A. If the application for withdrawal or LOA from the University is made by the students  from  the  start  date  of  the  semester  until  the  end  of  course registrations period they will be eligible for a refund. In order for the fees to be refunded, the students should have no financial obligation to the University. Students will be granted a refund of tuition fee for the relevant semester based on  the  time  frame  in  which  application  for  LOA  or  withdraw  is  made  via ASRM.
