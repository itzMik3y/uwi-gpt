We are the only Faculty with an ABET accredited programme in Jamaica. All other engineering programmes within the faculty are currently being revised and will be submitted to ABET for similar accreditation.

Our focus on the continuous improvement of our programmes along with the building upon the UWI's 2022 - 2027 strategic plan, ensures that the Faculty of Engineering remains at the forefront of the UWI's continued reputation as an  institution  of  global  excellence.  All  indicators  of  success  are  on  the  rise. Our graduates who enter the workforce are among the most demanded by industries. Those who  decide  to further their studies have had their excellence  awarded  with  Chevening  Scholarships  and  being  shortlisted  for Rhodes  Scholarships.  Our  Master  of  Philosophy  (MPhil)  and  Doctor  of Philosophy (PhD) research degree programmes commenced in 2018 and have been  going  well  A  MSc  in  Engineering  and  Management,  which  is  a  taught degree programme, which commenced in September 2021, is also offered by the Faculty.

We  continue  to  strengthen  our  partnerships  with  local  and  international industries  and  academia.  New  Fortress  Energy  offers  10  scholarships  each valued at US$5,000 per year for qualifying students.  Mona-Tech Engineering Services, the commercial arm of the Faculty of Engineering, which managed the commissioning of a 7 Megawatt Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plant for  the  Mona  campus  that  has  dramatically  reduced  the  campus's  energy costs,  continues  to  provide  internship  opportunities  at  this  facility  to  our engineering students.

We encourage your participation in the activities of the student engineering clubs (MES, JIE, IEEE, I-StructE) and also your support for our team preparing for the annual international robotics competition by the Institute of Electrical

and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) South East USA. We have continued to excel in  this  competition  and  have  won  3rd  place  on  two  occasions  among  54 participating  universities  in South  East  USA.  The  Faculty  of  Engineering continues  to  work  hard  towards  creating  a  Global  hub  for  engineering teaching,  research  and  practice;  with  strong  synergies  with  our  industrial, academic and commercial partners.

Engineering  students  have  been  and  will  continue  to  be  granted  internship opportunities at this facility.

- (b) Where a full-time student completes the Degree in more than eight (8) semesters, he/she shall not normally be eligible for Honours. Such a  student,  who  would  otherwise  meet  the  requirements  for  the award of a degree in accordance with the Faculty's regulations, shall be awarded a Pass Degree.

## CALCULATION OF GPA

3.21. (a) For  purposes  of  these  regulations,  the  following  meanings  shall apply, except where the context otherwise requires:

## i. Credits

The contact hours for a course are expressed in terms of Credits. The credit  rating  for  each  course  is  outlined  in  its  course  description document and follows the guidelines below for a semester:

-  3 hours of teaching per week, constitutes 3 credits
-  3 hours of laboratory exercises per week constitutes 1 credit
-  Tutorial times are assigned zero credits

The  total  number  of  credits  awarded  to  courses,  as  well  as  for projects, laboratory  sessions, foreign language  classes  or  other approved  contact  hours,  shall  be  determined  by  the  Faculty  Board and approved by the Board for Undergraduate Studies.

## ii. Credit Hours Earned

'Credit Hours Earned' means the credits for each course that count toward  the  degree  requirement  and  for  which  a  passing  grade  is obtained.

## iii. Quality Hours

'Quality Hours' mean the credits for each course that is included in the  GPA  calculations.  Quality  hours  shall  be  assigned  even  when  a grade of F is obtained in a course. Courses that are not used in the determination of the GPA shall be assigned zero quality hours.

## iv. Quality Points

'Quality Points' means the numerical value assigned to the relevant letter grade earned.

- (b) For  the  purpose  of  these  Regulations  the  following  meanings  shall apply:

## i. Levels 1, 2 and 3 Courses

Levels 1, 2 and 3 Courses are courses so designated by the Board for Undergraduate Studies. The numbers indicate the depth of knowledge  and  specialization  relevant  to  the  respective  discipline. Normally, all courses at a particular Level are offered in the corresponding year of the programme, e.g. Level 1 courses at Year 1 etc.

## ii. Grade Points

Grade points are determined by multiplying the quality hours by the quality points for a course.

## iii. Grade Point Average (GPA)

<!-- image -->

Grade  Point  Average  is  the  average  obtained  by  dividing  the  total grade points earned by the total quality hours for which the student has  registered,  excluding  courses  taken  on  a  Pass/  Fail  basis  and courses with designations entitled Additional Regulations.

## iv. Weighted Grade Point Average

The  Weighted  Grade  Point  Average  is  the  cumulative  average determined by applying appropriate weights of  10%, 30% and 60% for Levels 1, 2 and 3 courses, respectively, (except for the Final Year Project), to the grade points and the quality hours used in determining grade point average. Failed courses are also included in the determination of the GPA. Prior to any attempt at the final year project, the Weighted GPA is given by

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where:

Wpga is the weighted GPA,

Σ j QiCi is the summation  of  the  product  of  quality points Qi and credits Ci , for all courses taken at Level  . j

In the Faculty of Engineering, the Final Year project contributes 20% to  the  Weighted  GPA  calculation  used  to  determine  the  class  of degree.  Once  the  Final  Year  project  is  attempted,  the  weighted average is determined as follows :

where:

Qpi is  the  quality  points  earned  in  each  attempt  at  the

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

final year project.

## v. Semester Grade Point Average

Includes all approved courses for which the student is registered in a semester,  whether  passed  or  failed,  will  be  calculated  for  the determination of academic standing.

## vi. A Cumulative grade point average

Includes all courses completed excluding those taken on a Pass/Fail basis,  audited  courses,  Preliminary  courses  and  courses  designated Intermediate or Intermediate Pass will be calculated and recorded on the student's transcript.

## vii. Programme/Degree grade point average

Includes all Levels 1, 2 and 3 courses, whether passed or failed, will be calculated for determination of the class of the degree. All courses included in the computation  of  the  grade  point averages  are weighted according to the number of credits for the course.

- (c)  Courses for which credit and exemption have been given on the basis of qualifications obtained outside the Faculty/University shall not be taken into  account  in  this  calculation,  except  where  the  prescribed Schedule of Courses allows for a student to take a course outside of the Faculty of Engineering for credit.

## GUIDELINES FOR STAFF AND STUDENTS ON PLAGIARISM

Plagiarism  is  frowned  upon  in  the  University  and  as  such  penalties  will  be applied to any person found guilty of plagiarism. The following is an extract from The University of the West Indies Policy on Graduate Student Plagiarism approved by the Board for Graduate Studies and Research at its meeting in October 2010:

## Definition of Plagiarism:

Plagiarism  is  defined  as  the  unacknowledged  use  of  the words, ideas or creations of another. The principal categories  of unacknowledged  use  are  unacknowledged quotation,  which  is  failure  to  credit  quotations  of  another person s ' spoken or written words; and unattributed borrowing, which is failure to credit another person s ideas, ' opinions, theories, graphs or diagrams.

Unattributed  borrowing  also  includes  the  failure  to  credit another person s work when paraphrasing from that work. '

Cosmetic paraphrasing is also plagiarism. This occurs when, even  with  acknowledgment,  the  words  are  so  close  to  the original that what is deemed to have been paraphrased is, in fact a modified quote, but is not presented as such. A more technical form of plagiarism is wrongly attributed borrowing, where one does not acknowledge the work from which one obtained an idea, but quotes, instead, the original source  without  having  read  it.  This  may  well  convey  a broader  research  effort  than  that  actually  expended  and may perpetuate misinterpretation.

It  is  now  a  requirement  for  all  students  to  pass  their  written assignments, be it coursework, theses, research papers, project reports,  through  plagiarism  detection  software.  In  the  case  of theses, research papers and project reports, SUPERVISORS ARE REQUIRED TO SIT WITH THEIR STUDENTS AND RUN THE THESIS, RESEARCH PAPER OR PROJECT REPORT THROUGH TURNITIN in order  to  provide  guidance  on  any  revisions  that  may  be required as a result of this process. SUPERVISORS MUST THEN SIGN  THE  RELEVANT  FORMS  indicating  that  the  student  has indeed run their work through a plagiarism detection software.

Post Graduate Students submitting theses, research papers or project reports for examination must submit an electronic copy of the Turnitin report to the Office of Graduate Studies and Research . The similarity index in the Turnitin report should NOT BE HIGHER THAN 9%.

Please  note  that  if  it  exceeds  9%,  the  thesis,  project  report,  or  research paper  will  not  be  accepted  for  examination  by  the  Office  of  Graduate Studies and Research.

## UNIVERSITY REGULATIONS ON PLAGIARISM

## Application of these Regulations

- 1. These  Regulations  apply  to  the  presentation  of  work  by  a  student  for evaluation,  whether  or  not  for  credit,  but  do  not  apply  to  invigilated written examinations.

## Definition of plagiarism

- 2. In these Regulations, 'plagiarism' means  the  unacknowledged  and unjustified  use  of  the  words,  ideas  or  creations  of  another,  including unjustified unacknowledged quotation and unjustified unattributed borrowing;
-  ' Level  1  plagiarism ' means  plagiarism  which  does  not  meet  the definition of Level 2 plagiarism;
-  ' Level 2 plagiarism ' means plagiarism undertaken with the intention of  passing  off  as  original  work  by  the  plagiariser  work  done  by another person or persons.
- 3. What may otherwise meet the definition of plagiarism may be justified for  the  purposes  of  Regulation  2  where  the  particular  unacknowledged use of the words, ideas and creations of another is by the standards of the relevant academic discipline a function of part or all of the object of the work for evaluation whether or not for credit, for example:
- (a) The unacknowledged use is required for conformity with presentation standards;
- (b) The  task  set  or  undertaken  is  one  of  translation  of  the  work  of another into a different language or format;
- (c) The task set or undertaken requires producing a result by teamwork for joint credit regardless of the level of individual contribution;
- (d) The task set or undertaken requires extensive adaptation of models within a time period of such brevity as to exclude extensive attribution;
- (e) The task set or undertaken requires the use of an artificial language, such  as  is  the  case  with  computer  programming,  where  the  use  of unoriginal verbal formulae is essential.
- 4. It is not a justification under Regulations 2 and 3 for the unacknowledged use of the words, ideas and creations of another that the user enjoys the right of use of those words, ideas and creations as a matter of intellectual property.

## Other definitions

- 5. In  these  Regulations, ' Chairman ' means  the  Chairman  of  the  relevant Campus Committee on Examinations; ' Examination Regulations ' means the  Examination  and  other  forms  of  Assessment  Regulations  for  First Degrees  Associate  Degrees  Diplomas  and  Certificates  of  the  University; ' set of facts ' means a fact or combination of facts.

## Evidence of plagiarism

- 6. In  order  to  constitute  evidence  of  plagiarism  under  these  Regulations, there  shall  be  identified  as  a  minimum  the  passage  or  passages  in  the student's  work  which  are  considered  to  have  been  plagiarised  and  the passage or passages from which the passages in the student's work are considered to have been taken.

## Student Statement on Plagiarism

- 7. When a student submits for examination work under Regulation 1, the student shall sign a statement, in such form as the Campus Registrar may prescribe, that as far as possible the work submitted is free of plagiarism including  unattributed  quotation  or  paraphrase  of  the  work  of  another except where justified under Regulation 3.

<!-- image -->

- 8. Quotation or paraphrase is attributed for the purpose of Regulation 7 if the writer has indicated using conventions appropriate to the discipline that the work is not the writer's own.
- 9. The  University  is  not  prohibited  from  proceeding  with  a  charge  of plagiarism where there is no statement as prescribed under Regulation 7.

## Electronic vetting for plagiarism

- 10.  The results of any  electronic vetting although  capable,  where  the requirements of Regulation 7 are satisfied, of constituting evidence under these  Regulations,  are  not  thereby  conclusive  of  any  question  as  to whether or not plagiarism exists.

## Level 1 plagiarism

- 11.  In  work submitted for examination where the Examiner is satisfied that Level 1 plagiarism has been committed, he/she shall penalise the student by reducing the mark which would have otherwise been awarded taking into account any relevant Faculty regulations.

## Level 2 plagiarism

- 12.  Where  an  examiner  has  evidence  of  Level  2  plagiarism  in  the  material being examined, that examiner shall report it to the Head of Department or the Dean and may at any time provide the Registrar with a copy of that report. In cases where the examiner and the Dean are one and the same, the report shall be referred to the Head of the Department and also to the Campus Registrar.
- 13.  Where any other person who in the course of duty sees material being examined which he or she believes is evidence of Level 2 plagiarism that other person may report it to the Head of Department or the Dean and may at any time report it to the Campus Registrar  who shall take such action as may be appropriate.
- 14.  Where  a  Dean  or  Head  of  Department  receives  a  report  either  under Regulation 12 or 13, the Dean or Head of Department, as the case may be, shall:
- (a) where in concurrence with the report's identification of evidence of Level 2 plagiarism, report the matter to the Campus Registrar; or

- (b) where not concurring in the identification of evidence of plagiarism, reply to the examiner declining to proceed further on the report; or
- (c) where concluding that there is evidence of Level 1 plagiarism, reply to  the  examiner  indicating  that  conclusion  and  the  Examiner  shall proceed as under Regulation 11.
- 15.  Where a report is made to the Campus Registrar under Regulation 14a or 16, the Campus Registrar shall lay a charge and refer the matter to the Campus Committee on Examinations.
- 16.  Where the Campus Registrar receives a report alleging Level 2 plagiarism from  the  Examiner  or  any  other  person  except  the  Dean  or  Head  of Department,  the  Campus  Registrar  shall  refer  the  matter  to  a  senior academic to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to ground a charge  of  plagiarism  and  where  such  evidence  is  found,  the  Campus Registrar shall proceed as under Regulation 15.
- 17.  Where  the  matter  has  been  referred  to  the  Campus  Committee  on Examinations  pursuant  to  Regulation  15,  the  proceedings  under  these Regulations  prevail,  over  any  other  disciplinary  proceedings  within  the University  initiated  against  the  student  based  on  the  same  facts  and, without prejudice to Regulation 21, any other such disciplinary proceedings shall be stayed, subject to being reopened.
- 18.  If  the  Campus  Committee  on  Examinations  is  satisfied,  after  holding  a hearing,  that  the  student    has  committed  Level  2  plagiarism,  it  shall  in making  a  determination  on  the  severity of the penalty take into consideration:
- (a) the circumstances of the particular case;
- (b) the seniority of the student; and
- (c) whether this is the first or a repeated incidence of Level 2 plagiarism.
- 19.  Where the Campus Committee is of the view that the appropriate penalty for an offence of Level 2 plagiarism is for the student to be:
- (a) awarded a fail mark;
- (b) excluded from some or all further examinations of the University for such period as it may determine;
- (c) be dismissed from the University, it shall make such recommendation to the Academic Board.

## Clearance on a charge of Level 2 plagiarism

- 20. A determination of the Campus Committee on Examinations that Level 2 plagiarism has not been found will be reported to the Campus Registrar who  shall  refer  it  to  the  Examiner  and  notify  the  student.  Where  the Committee has not identified Level 2 but has identified Level 1, it shall be reported to the Campus Registrar who shall refer it to the examiner.

## Level 2 plagiarism: Appeal to the Senate

- 21.  A student may appeal to the Senate from any decision against him or her on a charge of plagiarism made by Academic Board.

## Delegation by Dean or Head of Department

- 22. The Dean or Head of Department, as the case may be, may generally or in a particular instance delegate that officer's functions under these Regulations.

## Conflict of interest disqualification

- 23.  Any  person  who  has  at  any  time  been  an  examiner  of  work  or  been involved in procedures for laying charges in relation to which an issue of plagiarism  is  being  considered  under  these  Regulations  shall  withdraw from performing any functions under these Regulations other than those of supervisor and examiner.

## PRELIMINARY ENGINEERING (1 year qualifying programme)

## Head of Programme: Dr. Roxann Stennett-Brown

<!-- image -->

The overall aims of this preliminary engineering programme are to:

-  provide  a  programme  structure  that  allows  students  to  qualify  for transition  into  any  of  the  BSc  Engineering  programmes  within  The UWI, Mona;
-  provide the requisite foundation in mathematics, sciences, laboratory techniques and communication skills that are required for a beginner engineering student; and
-  facilitate  increased  enrolment  in  engineering  to  meet  the  future needs of our industries.

Students  are  required  to  register  for  30  credits  of  courses  across  two semesters. These courses will facilitate the development of competencies in mathematics, sciences, laboratory skills, technical writing, along with exposure to softer skills via electives from social sciences and humanities. The credits  for  these  courses will  not be  added  to  any  of  the  BSc  Engineering programmes in The UWI and will only serve to qualify students for access to the BSc Engineering programmes .
