## legal notice/DISCLAIMER

Notwithstanding the contents of Faculty Handbooks, Course Outlines or any other course materials  provided  by  the  University,  the  University  reserves  the  right  at  any  time  to altogether withdraw, alter or modify its programmes or courses and/or vary its modes or methods of teaching, delivery and assessment of its programmes or courses, as deemed necessary in the following circumstances:

- a) As a result of any changes imposed by national laws, legislation or governmental regulations or orders made from time to time;
- b) In response to the occurrence of a force majeure event, including but not limited to,  war  (whether  declared  or  not),  riots,  civil  disorder,  epidemics,  pandemics, quarantines, earthquakes, fire, explosions, storms, floods or other adverse weather conditions, strikes, lockouts or other industrial action, confiscation or any other action or authority by governmental or regulatory agencies or acts of God;
- c) In the event of an emergency where there is risk to life and property;
- d) Where the exigencies of the circumstances require such action to be taken by the University.

## Disclaimer

The information contained in this undergraduate handbook is designed to provide helpful information regarding regulations governing the Faculty of Humanities and Education and all the undergraduate programmes offered by the Faculty.

Every effort was made to ensure that the information in this Handbook was accurate at the time of publication.  However, students are encouraged to check the Faculty's website as well as their respective departments during the course of the academic year for updates, corrections, and any omissions that may have emerged since its publication.

## Purpose of the handbook

This Undergraduate Handbook is intended for use by prospective, new and continuing students as well as staff of the Faculty and provides information on all the courses and programmes  of  study  offered  by  the  Faculty.    The  Handbook  also  sets  out  those regulations of the Faculty (e.g. those governing registration, the award of Degree, leave of  absence,  etc.)  which  are  essential  for  the  aforementioned  groups  to  know.   The regulations contained herein, should however be used as a supplement rather than a substitute for the official sources of University policies and procedures.

It is important that the programme requirements outlined in this Handbook are strictly observed by all newly-admitted students (i.e. those accepted to the Faculty for the 2024/2025 academic year), all students who transferred into the Faculty during the said academic year, as well as those students who were approved for a change of Major/Special/Minor within the Faculty during the 2024/2025 academic year.

It is equally important that each student ensures that the University/Faculty regulations are observed.

Courses are subject to change and may not necessarily be available in a given year or semester.  Correspondingly, the Faculty retains the right to cancel any course in any semester if registration numbers are insufficient.  Students are therefore encouraged to check with departmental advisors regarding possible changes and/or cancellations.

Students are also encouraged to seek academic advice from their Academic Advisors and/or Heads of Department.

## glossary

Anti-requisites refer  to  courses  where  content  overlap  precludes  courses  being  taken together for credit. Students are urged to view the listing in Part V of this Handbook and consult their Department for guidance.

Core/compulsory  courses  vs  elective  courses : Programme  requirements  consist  of compulsory and elective courses. While core/compulsory courses are listed by name, there are two types of elective courses. These are (i) 'free elective', which can be selected from any Department or Faculty at the appropriate level, or (ii) 'departmental elective' where the discipline and level are usually specified. For example, the requirement may call for 'two Level  III  Psychology  electives'.  Altogether,  they  must  be  completed  to  make  up  the  90 credits required to be awarded a degree.

Credit refers  to  a  unit  of  study  counting  towards  a  degree  or  diploma.  Undergraduate courses in the Faculty normally carry a weighting of three (3) credits. A number of courses, however, carry a weighting of six (6) or nine (9) credits.

Credit  hours  earned refers  to  the  credits  for  each  course  that  count  toward  the  degree requirement and for which a passing grade is obtained.

Exemption  with  credit refers  to  cases  where  a  student  is  granted  exemption  from  UWI courses because the student has already passed courses in other programmes at the UWI or  passed courses  of  similar  content  at  other  recognized  institutions.  Students  are  not required to take replacement courses. Requests should be made via the Automated Student Request System (ASRS) accessed via Student Administrative System (SAS).

Exemption without credit refers to cases where a student is granted exemption from UWI courses because s/he has already passed equivalent courses/subjects at other recognized institutions or from other examination bodies. Students granted exemption without credit are required to take replacement courses. Requests should be made via the Automated Student Request System (ASRS) accessed via Student Administrative System (SAS).

Leave of absence is granted to a student who is unable to continue his/her studies for a semester or more for financial, work related, personal or medical reasons. Permission must be requested using the Automated Student Request System (ASRS) accessed via the online portal Student Administrative System (SAS).

LeveI represents the different standard of courses that must be completed in the degree programme. There are three levels, namely level I, level II, and level III representing the three years for completion of the BA/BFA/BEd. Degree. These are designated by the first numeral in the course code, e.g., HIST1201 (Level I), LITS2906 (Level II) and MDIA3005 (Level III).

Major: A major comprises 90 credits, with at least thirty-six (36) credits in the subject area at Levels II and III.

Minor: A minor consists of a minimum of fifteen (15) credits in the subject area at Levels II and III and must be pursued in conjunction with a major

Option/Special : An option/special is comprised of a minimum of 90 credits with forty-five (45) credits in the subject area at Levels II and III.

Pre-requisites are courses which must be completed before being permitted to register for a  higher-level  course,  e.g.,  LIBS1003  must  be  successfully  completed  before  taking LIBS2103.

## Faculty overview

The  Faculty  of  Humanities  and  Education  evolved  out  of  the  original  Faculty  of  Arts established in 1950 and the Faculty of Arts and General Studies which was started in 1964 to co-ordinate the teaching of General Degree studies instituted in 1963. In 1996, the Faculty of Arts and General Studies was merged with the Faculty of Education and became the Faculty of Arts and Education. In 2002, the decision was taken to rename the Faculty to the Faculty of Humanities and Education.

The Faculty of Humanities and Education enjoys a long tradition for excellence in teaching and pioneering research in cultural studies, education, history, library studies, linguistics, literature, media and communication, modern languages and philosophy.

Departments in the Humanities and Education have made significant on-going contributions to the work of the Caribbean Examinations Council, as well as to the Joint Board of Teacher Education. The Faculty has significantly contributed to the development of regional thinking, professional standards and to the building of Caribbean identities.

## Message from the dean

## PROF. SILVIA KOUWENBERG

Welcome  to the Faculty of Humanities &amp; Education - your place to shine!

The  Faculty's  eight  departments  offer  degree programmes which cover the full breadth of the Humanities &amp; Education. These include

pioneering multi-disciplinary programmes such as Liberal Studies, Cultural &amp; Creative Industries, Film Studies, Languages &amp; Linguistics, or Music &amp; Performance Studies - programmes in which students are able to select from among several concentrations to build a degree which is uniquely theirs.

Our  degree  offerings  allow  students  to  earn  professional  qualifications  in  teaching  and educational administration, in Caribbean sign language interpreting, and in librarianship  - the latter unique for the region. Our programmes include degrees in literatures, French and Spanish, philosophy,  history,  and  linguistics.  Through  our  degree  programmes,  students  can  seek qualifications  in  entertainment  management,  information  studies,  writing  and  publishing, journalism, marketing, animation, film production, and digital media.

The major-minor system opens up additional opportunities for introducing secondary specialisations in such areas as cultural studies, reggae studies, Rastafari studies, music studies, Chinese,  Japanese,  creative  writing,  and  many  others.  Through  our  collaborations  across departments,  faculties  and  affiliate  institutions,  our  students  can  also  pursue  degrees  in geography,  computing,  history  and  international  relations,  French  with  international  relations, linguistics &amp; language education, mathematics, theology, and ministerial studies.

The Faculty holds to core values such as student-centredness, integrity, inclusion, diversity, and ethical responsibility. This means that we are committed to the design and delivery of quality programmes, to the provision of supporting services such as academic counselling and writing support, and to approaching all students with respect. Whichever programme is your choice, you can be assured that you will be immersed in courses which will equip you for the twenty-first century, and that you will encounter some of the best researchers and practitioners in your field of study as your lecturers and academic mentors. It is my ardent wish that you will soon join the ranks of proud graduates of the Faculty of Humanities &amp; Education and I wish you every success in the pursuit of that goal.

## Message from the faculty's guild representative

## MR. ADRIAN McCARTHY

'Up,  you  mighty  race,  accomplish  what  you  will'  Marcus Garvey

Welcome, Owlets! On behalf of the Guild Committee of the Faculty of Humanities and Education, it is my pleasure to greet you as you embark on your  academic  journey  here  at  The  University  of  the  West  Indies.  Congratulations  on reaching this milestone, whether you are fresh out of sixth form or returning after a hiatus.

As you navigate through your  academic career, you may encounter familiar challenges: sleepless  nights,  adjusting  to  new  levels  of  learning,  and  feeling  out  of  place  in  a  new environment. But remember, my Owlets, you possess greatness that will guide you through. You are not alone on this journey; your Guild Committee is here to ensure your voice is heard and your concerns addressed.

Our  Faculty  boasts  a  diverse  and  talented  student  body,  and  this  year,  I'm  excited  to showcase  your  abilities  through  various  events  and  initiatives.  I  encourage  you  to  get involved with your committee, participate in discussions, and engage with your representatives. Let us make this academic year exceptional together.

Join  our  subcommittees,  share  your  ideas,  and  let  us  advance  the  Owl  Experience. Remember, the owl is the symbol of Wisdom, Knowledge and many other qualities within that sphere and it is my hope that this year, you will be a beacon of the same. Together, we will  create  a  vibrant  and  supportive  community  within  the  Faculty  of  Humanities  and Education.

Welcome aboard, Owlets and welcome back owls!

Forza Azul! One HumEd!

## UWI Policies on Disability, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion

## STATEMENT ON STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES

'The University of the West Indies [hereafter UWI] is consciously seeking to facilitate the efforts of persons with disabilities to acquire university education. The university's goal is that  as  far  as  possible  the  number  of  students  with  disabilities  at  the  institution  be increasingly brought in line with the number of disabled persons in the relevant age cohorts in the wider society. It is the aim that no student whose academic qualifications are good enough to qualify for competitive entry be unable to accept a place at the UWI because of a disability'.

(UWI Finance &amp; General Purposes Committee, 1995).

## STATEMENT ON EQUITY, DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION

The  University  of  the  West  Indies'  Commitments  to  Equity,  Diversity  and  Inclusion.  The University of the West Indies (The UWI) recognizes the importance of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion  (ED&amp;I).  These  principles  are  among  the  organisation's  core  values  and  play  a central role in the Triple A Strategy, 2017-2022; they are also present in the Statement of Ethical  Principles  and  Code  of  Conduct  (2018/2019)  and  guide  the  institution  towards creating "greater and more affordable access to reduce social inequality in the region."1 These ED&amp;I principles set the norm for "a fair and just environment" in which all employees of The UWI "are able to access opportunities that allow for full participation."

The UWI vouches to provide a study and work environment which must be "inclusive of and affirm the dignity of all persons regardless of race, socio-economic status, age, sex, gender identity  and  expression,  physical  and  mental  ability,  sexual  orientation,  family  or  marital status, national origin, language, political or religious persuasion, health status, and other characteristics that make its constituents unique."

(To access to entire policy visit UWI Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Policy)

## Code of Principles and Responsibilities for Students

## I. PREAMBLE

Rights operate within a system of fundamental values. Rights and privileges go hand in hand  with  their  corresponding  duties,  obligations  and  responsibilities.  Such  are  the principles that bind student membership in The University of the West Indies community with the fundamental values, rights and responsibilities of the University as a community. This Code sets out the ground rules, considered consistent with the goals and well-being of the University, for the conduct of all students who belong to the University community. This Code  of  Principles  and  Responsibilities  has  been  written  to  define  and  explain  rights, obligations  and  responsibilities  of  students  while  they  are  members  of  the  University community. It has been written cooperatively by students, faculty and staff. In addition, it seeks to set out the procedures in place to review incidents of misconduct. This Code is subject to and limited by the Laws of the individual Campus Countries and the Charter, Statutes, Ordinances and Regulations of the University.

## II. THE UNIVERSITY'S COMMUNITY PRINCIPLES

The University's mission is to advance learning, create knowledge and foster innovation for the positive transformation of the Caribbean and the wider world. The University recognises that as a regional university supported by the West Indian peoples, and as the sole local institution  equipped  to  meet  local  requirements  and  to  relate  its  own  developmental programmes to them, it should give priority to regional needs. All members of staff are also part  of  this  educational  community.  They  cooperate  to  promote  student  learning,  to disseminate and impart knowledge, to develop new knowledge and ideas.

The  University's  responsibility  includes  providing,  for  the  student,  the  resources  and opportunities for self-improvement and for the development of the potential necessary for success within and beyond the portals of the University.  The values identified serve as the foundation for the policies and regulations governing the conduct of students and of staff. Membership in the University presumes, on the part of the student, a preparedness to help shape and support a community based on these values.

## Faculty and programme REGULATIONS

## 1. REGISTRATION REGULATIONS

Students must register for courses at the beginning of each academic year unless they wish to take leave of absence or voluntarily withdraw.

- 1.1 Registration for a course constitutes registration for the examinations in that course. Beyond  specified  dates,  students  will  be  financially  obligated  for  courses  on  their registration that have not been dropped.
- 1.2 A student who has successfully completed a course will not be permitted to re-register for that course under any circumstances.
- 1.3 A student is deemed to have completed registration for a course when his/her financial obligations to the University have been fulfilled.
- 1.4 Deadlines for changes of registration including withdrawal from or addition of courses will be as prescribed in University Regulations.
- 1.5 Applications for late registration and late adjustment to registration may be subject to a fine to be determined by the Academic Board.

- 1.7 Students shall not be permitted to change their course of study in their first year.

## REQUIREMENTS FOR ENTRY TO LEVEL II AND LEVEL III COURSES

- 1.8 Students are reminded that Level II and III courses often have prerequisites. The details of  these  prerequisites  are  available  in  the  sections  entitled  'Course  Listing'  in  this Handbook, and students are advised to ensure, by forward planning, that they acquire the prerequisites to the courses they intend to pursue in succeeding years.

## FULL-TIME AND PART-TIME REGULATIONS

- 1.9 All students are initially registered as full-time or part-time students but may apply to the Faculty Office via the Student Administration System (SAS) portal https://sas.mona.uwi.edu/, to change their enrolment status.

## FULL-TIME PROGRAMME REGULATION:

- 1.10 All students are initially registered as full-time or part-time students but may apply to the Faculty Office via the Student Administration System (SAS) portal https://sas.mona.uwi.edu/, to change their enrolment status.

- 1.11 Throughout the entire degree programme, no more than 30 credits (distributed so as not to exceed 12 credits in any one year of the full time programme) may be selected from courses other than Humanities courses, except with the special permission of the Dean.
- 1.12 Full-time students are required to register for a minimum of 24 credits and a maximum of 30 credits in an academic year.

## PART-TIME PROGRAMME REGULATION

- 1.14 Part-time status refers to the course workload and does not imply evening studies. While some courses are offered in the evening, others are available only during the day. Therefore, students enrolled part-time should be prepared to attend classes between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m.
- 1.15 Part-time students with lower level matriculation may transfer to full-time status after gaining a minimum of 15 credits.  Requests for change of status should be made online via the SAS portal https://sas.mona.uwi.edu/ at the beginning of the academic year.
- 1.16 Part-time students are expected to register for a maximum of eighteen (18) credits for the academic year.

- 1.20 The grading of co-curricular credits will be pass/fail.
- 1.21 Co-curricular credits shall not be taken into account in the determination of class of degree. They will however form part of the 90 credits required for a degree programme.
- 1.22 All co-curricular  activities/programmes  must  be  approved  by  Academic  Board  on  the recommendation of the relevant Faculty Committee.

## CATEGORIES OF COURSES/COURSE WEIGHTING

- 1.23 Each course is classified either as a Foundation course or as a Faculty course.
- 1.24 Each course is designated as appropriate to Level I, II or III (indicated by the first numeral in the course code). The exceptions are FOUN1201 and FOUN1301 which are counted as level II courses in the Faculty of Humanities and Education and should normally be done at this level.
- 1.25 Courses have a normal weighting of three (3) credits, except for some courses, whose weighting is 6 credits.
- 1.26 Courses taught over an academic year (i.e. year-long or across semesters 1 and 2) normally carry a weighting of six (6) credits. Students must register for these courses in both semesters.
- 1.27 In the case of substitution for a 6-credit course, the alternative should be either another 6-credit course or two 3-credit courses.

## MESSAGE from the director

## DR. PATRICK PRENDERGAST

Welcome  to  the  premier  school  for  training  and  education  in media and communication across the Caribbean - The Caribbean School of Media and Communication (CARIMAC). This year is a critical one in the history of CARIMAC. It is also seminal for the University  of  the  West  Indies  and  the  people  of  the  Caribbean

region. In October 1974, the Mona campus opened its doors to higher education for the region's growing journalism and mass communication sector and in doing so created a turning point for not only the practice of journalism in the Caribbean, but also for the media's vital role in defending the public interest. Fifty years ago, 31 students from across the region started the Diploma in Mass Communication. Today, CARIMAC is a world-renowned academy offering undergraduate degrees in journalism, film production, digital media  production,  animation,  and  integrated marketing communication. There are also graduate programmes in communication studies, communication for  social and behaviour change, integrated marketing communication and media management. Additionally, there has  been  an  exponential  growth  of  the  school's  research  agenda  and engagement in online education.  This is evidenced by its MPhil/PhD programme and demonstrates its adaptability  and  commitment  to  staying  at  the  forefront  of  industry  development  while contributing to the global body of knowledge in communication studies.

Even as we celebrate this milestone and significant changes to our programming, we must recommit and reimagine our promise to addressing gaps in Caribbean media and communication theory and praxis, to informing both academic pursuits and practical applications in the field, and to promoting and building internationally bench-marked professional standards and practice across the industry.

This is the CARIMAC to which you belong - a distinguished School with a rich legacy of excellence in media and communication training and education at an internationally top-ranked University prepared to create new opportunities for you to collaborate, network, and grow with the many top-notch specialists that have gone through the diverse range of undergraduate and graduate programmes we offer. Your experience will reflect our commitment to equipping students with the knowledge, skills, and competencies necessary to excel in various sectors of the industry, as well as to make a positive impact on advancing the global community in which we all live, work and play. CARIMAC's emphasis on holistic development and partnership with our students underscores our philosophy  of  education  as  nurturing  future  leaders  and  innovators  in  the industry. Your responsibility  as  students  is  to  dedicate  your  university  journey  to  sustaining  the  legacy  of excellence, commitment to professionalism, and positive impact on society. Be an active participant in shaping the future of media and communication in your homeland, the Caribbean region, and the global space.

Congratulations  on  your  many  successes  to  come  and  welcome  to  what  will  be  an engaging and productive academic year at the Caribbean School of Media and Communication

Patrick Prendergast, PhD

## BACHELOR OF FINE ARTS  BFA | ANIMATION ( )

The  Bachelor  of  Fine  Arts  (BFA)  Animation  is  a  three-year  programme  designed  to  produce graduates skilled in animation capable of working independently or becoming employed in local, regional and international animation production enterprises. Animation is an expansive art form with multiple  sub-areas  that  must  be  mastered.  Students  will  not  specialize  in  any  one  animation discipline but will instead be exposed to multiple techniques and production workflows in the areas of 2D and 3D Animation, as well as Motion Graphics. This programme aims to create well-rounded generalist animators capable of participating at multiple points of the production pipeline in the various animation disciplines

Students will be taught the history and principles of 2D Animation, which act as a foundation for the teaching of other aspects of animation. Key concepts in the area of motion analysis will also be taught  consistently  throughout  the  programme.  Every  student  must  develop  a  commanding knowledge of key framing, squash and stretch, anticipation and overlapping action as tenets of the professional practice. These techniques are commonplace in 2D Animation but are also applicable to 3D Animation and Motion Graphics, which will also be taught. Students will be trained in the use of industry-standard software while also taking part in courses geared at developing the higher order skills required to execute complex animation and motion graphics productions.

A robust competency in drawing is at the core of this programme since each animation sub-area requires a high-level of drawing dexterity. A series of drawing courses throughout the three years of the programme provides continuous development of the students' drawing ability. The content of these  courses  are  aligned  with  assignments  in  the  core  animation  courses,  supporting  and reinforcing the content being covered. The programme combines both critical theory and applied production, with drawing serving as a prime tool for conceptual character and scenic development.

## BA Integrated Marketing Communication

The Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Integrated Marketing Communication (IMC) programme fundamentally addresses changes that are taking place in an increasingly converged media and communication environment, where agencies and institutions - corporate, state and para-statal - offer a range of services rather than being engaged as discrete, stand-alone operations. This level of integration that is  created  by  convergence in media and communication is at the heart of this programme. The intention is to produce a graduate who will be competent on converged communication platforms.

Integrated  marketing  communication  (IMC)  brings  convergence  of  thoughts,  processes  and techniques in communication. As public relations and advertising become more interrelated and the field  of  marketing  becomes  more  concerned  with social and  behavioural  change,  the  benefit of convergence in promotional, organisational and interpersonal communication becomes even more obvious.  IMC  is  a  coordinated  strategic  programme  of  total  communication  and  is  the  most advanced system of communication analysis and planning geared towards maximising efficiency and effectiveness in the design, development and delivery of communication strategies, tactics and tools.

Graduates of the BA in Integrated Marketing Communication programme would have been prepared to  become  leaders  in  the  process  of  providing  an  integrated  communication  experience  for  its publics - public, corporate, or social.  Consumer or consumption communication is in increasing demand  internationally.  So  too  is  behaviour  change  education  and  communication.    Both  are demanding research, planning and design skills in advertising, public relations,  promotions, and commercial  and  social  marketing  that  are  effectively  and  efficiently  developed,  implemented, evaluated and reported on. Graduates from this programme will find careers in corporate public relations,  government  information  agencies,  institutional  profiling,  marketing,  social  marketing, events planning and management, and electronic commerce.

*Entertainment and Cultural Enterprise Management (ECEM) majors who are  desirous of pursuing the minor  in  Integrated  Marketing  Communication  (IMC),  but  who  are  already  required  to  take  either IMCC2601 or MKTG2001 as part of their major, should bear in mind that IMCC2601 cannot be used to satisfy both the major and minor.  These students are therefore advised to register for one of the other Level II courses listed under the IMC minor.

## Message from THE Head of Department

DR. JULIAN CRESSER

Welcome  to  the  2024-2025  academic  year  and thank  you  for  joining  us  as  we  continue  Moving Forward with History and Archaeology. The tagline has a double meaning: in the first place, it recognizes  that  an  understanding  of  the  past  -

gained through the disciplines of History and Archaeology - is essential for charting our future courses. Secondly, it is a nod to the fact that these disciplines have to evolve to meet the needs of  rapidly  changing  societies.  In  particular,  the  experiences  of  the  last  three  years  have revealed the need to equip our graduates with transferable skills that can sustain a careerlong-learning and adaptability.

The DOHA has responded to these needs through a systematic revision of our undergraduate programmes and course offerings. In addition to our core History and History &amp; Archaeology degrees, we are pleased to welcome students doing Majors History &amp; International Relations, and History &amp; Journalism. Newer courses like Digital History expose students to new media for the research, teaching and presentation of History and the broader Humanities. Our finalyear Capstone research project also allows students the flexibility of presenting their work in a variety of multi-media formats. All the while you will be learning about past-present-future connections,  and  engaging  in  conversations  with  lecturers  and  peers  that  will  help  you  to develop informed perspectives on the Caribbean's and the World's past.

One thing that has not, and will not, change is our commitment to excellence in education as this remains the best way that we can help you prepare to succeed in a constantly changing and  competitive  world.  The  Department  is  committed  to  being  student-oriented  and maintaining the synergies between student and staff from which we can all benefit. Please, make sure to use the Department's website, social media and other communication channels and share your feedback, as we continue breaking ground for the History and Archaeology Department of the future.

Welcome again.

## Course Descriptions

## HISTORY, ARCHAEOLOGY AND HERITAGE STUDIES

## LEVEL I

## HIST1003:  CARIBBEAN MEDIA HISTORY SINCE 1717

This survey course introduces students to a pan-Caribbean history of mass media, tracing its evolution since the first printing press was established in Jamaica in 1717 through to the twentieth century and beyond with the invention of film, radio, television and the internet. Among the themes covered is the development of the mass media within various watershed periods  in the Caribbean,  such  as  slavery, emancipation,  independence  and  postindependence developments. The course also examines mass communication and culture in  the  Caribbean, as well as the influence of certain factors such as ownership, and the important role played by governments, particularly with regards to control and censorship. Emphasis  is  placed  on  the  technology  involved  in  the  production  and  consumption  of information in the Caribbean media industry, especially in the current digital age. The course will also critically assess the impact of international developments on Caribbean media.

## HIST1018:  THE ORIGINS AND GROWTH OF MODERN SPORT, 1850-1945

This course examines the origins and growth of modern sport during a period, 1850-1945, where amateurism was largely replaced by professionalism. It looks at the origins of the various  traditional  sports  in  Europe,  Asia  and  North  America  (football,  cricket,  boxing, basketball, baseball etc.) and how they spread throughout the world and assumed global proportions. This all became possible with the formal organization of sports and the rise of international competitions such as the FIFA World Cup and the Olympics.  This course deals broadly with the various values associated with sport during this period related to race, class and gender and the impact of the Industrial revolution in Britain and social movements such as Muscular Christianity. This course aims to give the student a greater understanding and appreciation of sporting activities that are cherished all over the world.

## HIST1201:   AN INTRODUCTION TO WORLD HISTORY

An Introduction to World History provides a general and broad overview of key historical developments and themes that will allow students to gain a basic understanding of major changes throughout the past leading to the development of contemporary societies. The course will centre around one specific theme-economic  change,  political power, population  movement,  or  cultural  expansion-in  order  to  explore  significant  political, economic,  social  and  cultural  transformations  across  major  regions  of  the  world, particularly  Africa,  Asia,  Europe  and  the  Americas.  By  examining  key  historical  themes students will be able to learn about global developments such as the formation of sedentary societies from 8000 BCE and later rise of ancient states, the significance of the expansion of material and cultural innovations from 500 BCE, the impact of Islamic and Euro-Christian hegemonies in configuring the modern world, the importance of political revolutions and industrialisation in shaping modern states and societies from the mid-eighteenth century,

the global impact of hegemonic militarism in the twentieth century, or the socio-cultural changes  triggered  by  globalization  in  an  increasingly  multilateral  world  since  the  latetwentieth century.

## HIST1305:  AFRICA'S HISTORY IN REVERSE

Africa's  History  in  Reverse  introduces  students  to  major  themes  necessary  for  the understanding  of  the  continent's  long  and  diverse  history,  paying  special  attention  to regional patterns. It does so by exploring Africans' historical experiences in reverse, from the present to its distant past. The course starts by discussing the modern relationship between Africa and the African diaspora in an attempt to understand what it means to be African for those in and outside the continent today. It then explores some of the main challenges African societies have experienced since independence, laying the ground to examine the short colonial period and its significance in shaping modern African societies. The  course  then  moves  to  the  nineteenth  century  and  explores  Africans'  innovative responses to the challenges triggered by the advance of  globalization  before  European colonization.  The  course  subsequently  examines  the  ways  in  which  the  Atlantic  trade influenced social and political change in West and Central Africa. Maritime contacts are further  explored  by  looking  at  Eastern  and  Southern  Africa  to  discuss  the  interaction between internal and external dynamics in shaping change within these regions. Continuing with the theme of regional contacts, the course then examines the influence of MiddleEastern historical developments across large African regions since the birth of Islam. As students are taken further back into Africa's past, the course explores the significance of the Nile, the Mediterranean and the Red Sea to cultural innovations and the formation of African ancient states. Finally, the course resumes the theme of identity to explore the role of migration in spreading and diversifying African cultures from ancient times.

## HIST1407:   CONTINUITY AND CHANGE IN EARLY MODERN EUROPE, 1400 TO C. 1789

This course examines how people in early modern Europe envisioned themselves and their changing culture.  Running from c. 1350 to c. 1760 the course will introduce students to the Renaissance and the Reformation in Europe through the cultural transformations that these movements provoked along with their long-term social repercussions.  It offers foundations for upper level European and trans-Atlantic courses.

## HIST1505:   THE ASIAN WORLD PRIOR TO 1600

The course is a survey of the major themes in the history of Asia beginning with an analysis of notion of culture and civilization.  It covers the three main cultural and religious centres and their traditions: Southwest Asia, with the focus at first in Mesopotamia and with the main thread of continuity being the great tradition of Iran/Persia, which includes Islam since the  seventh  century;  secondly  the  Hindu-Buddhist  culture  of  India,  marked  by  a  great diversity of race and language; and thirdly, the Confucian tradition of the Far East with China as the centre.  Special emphasis is given to the governments within each culture and to the contacts within the Asian world.  The continent's trading centres and their routes - the silk trade and the spice trade are examined.

## HIST1601:   THE ATLANTIC WORLD, 1400-1600

This course entails a study of the creation of one of the most significant regional systems in world history, a system unified by the Atlantic Ocean. The course focuses on how distinct and separate cultural and biological areas that surrounded the Atlantic were integrated into a network of exchange rooted in the long-distance movement of people, plants, animals, commodities and ideas. Demographic, economic and cultural consequences are emphasized.

## HST1604:    'OUT OF MANY': THE DEVELOPMENT OF JAMAICAN SOCIETY

This survey course provides students with an overview of Jamaican history, beginning with the arrival of indigenous peoples through to European conquest, African enslavement and post-emancipation indentured labourers to independence and beyond. Among the issues covered  is  the  emergence  of  different  systems  of  government,  race,  class  and  gender relations, creolisation and retention of cultural practices, labour unrest and the evolution of the  island's  economy  from  slave-based  agriculture  to  a  more  diversified  one  based  on manufacturing and tourism. By tracing the island's political, economic, social and cultural development,  the  course  focuses  on  historical  antecedents  that  have  shaped  modern Jamaica. Central to this conversation is the contributions by the different groups who came to the island, making Jamaica 'out of many', but raising the question of whether this has truly led to the creation of 'one people'.

## HIST1704:   THE STUDY OF THE PAST IN THE ATLANTIC WORLD

'The Study of the Past in the Atlantic World' is a learning-by-doing course that seeks to introduce  students to  the  use  of  key  historical  methods  to  study  and  interpret  the  past around the theme of the Atlantic World, with a special emphasis on the Caribbean region. While the course is primarily conceived to help students to advance through any of the degrees  offered  by  the  Department  of  History  and  Archaeology,  it  will  also  prove  most valuable for students from other disciplines who appreciate the contribution of historical skills and methods to their own field. Throughout this course, students will be able to learn about the relevance of critically engaging with the past to understanding the complex world in  which we live, while producing comprehensible historical narratives that can enhance other forms of reporting. The course is divided into five units that will incrementally build basic  skills  for  conducting  historical  research,  by  focusing  on  specific  problems  and questions relevant to understanding the influence of the Atlantic in shaping key historical transformations across different regions, and which set in motion the development of a true 'new  world'  in  the  Caribbean.  This  course  addresses  problems  of  central  interest  to students of history, such as: trade and economic transformations; territorial and political expansion;  identity  and  conflict;  religious  and  cultural  change;  social  formations  and domination; migration and displacement of people; labour control; disease and environment; and material culture.

## HIST1801:    INTRODUCTION TO ARCHAEOLOGY

This course provides an introduction to the discipline of archaeology and is a prerequisite for students wanting to take any further courses in archaeology. The course deals with the theoretical  and  practical  aspects  of  the  discipline,  including  the  goals  and  approaches employed by archaeologists. Important topics to be covered are the development of the discipline as a scientific endeavour, the multidisciplinary and specialized nature of modern archaeology, the nature of archaeological fieldwork, types of archaeological sites, types of

archaeological  evidence,  post-excavation  procedures,  the  variety  of  careers  open  to archaeologists, and the nature of Jamaican archaeology.

## HIST1901:   INTRODUCTION TO HERITAGE STUDIES

This course provides a basic understanding of Heritage Studies. The course is divided into 4 sections- (1) The concept of Heritage Studies-What is Heritage Studies; its relationship with History; its value and relevance, (2) Sources used for researching Heritage Studies (3) Topics in Heritage Studies (4) Methodology.

## HIST2006:  CONQUEST, COLONIZATION AND RESISTANCE IN THE CARIBBEAN, 1600 THE END OF SLAVERY

This  course,  which  spans  the  period  1600-1886,  examines  the  primary  forces  and characteristic features evident in the Caribbean between the European invasion and the ending  of  the  various  slave  regimes.    It  is  concerned  with  the  ways  in  which  conquer, colonization,  revolution  of  the  plantation  system,  slavery  and  imperialism  affected  the course  of  Caribbean  history  and  fostered  a  spirit  of  resistance  in  its  indigenous  and enslaved African people. It looks comparatively at the slave regimes in the Anglophone, Francophone and Hispanophone Caribbean and examines the degree to which the exploited and marginalised [male and female] were able to refashion their world and bring about a collapse of slavery and the plantation system.  A significant objective of the course is to use  the  revisionist  sources  to  interrogate  the  traditional  and  often  racist/Eurocentric representations of Caribbean history and facilitate an engagement with counter-discourse. The course will pay attention to the diversity of Caribbean populations and take on broad issues of class, colour, gender and ethnicity.

## HIST2007:   FREEDOM, DECOLONIZATION AND INDEPENDENCE IN THE CARIBBEAN SINCE 1804

This  course  offers  a  comparative  analysis  of  socio-economic,  cultural  and  political structures within the Danish, Dutch, English, French and Spanish speaking territories of the Caribbean  region  developed  from  the  immediate  post-slavery  period  through  to  1990. Measures aimed at transforming these former slave/ plantation economies into modern nationalist  states  within  the  context  of  the  international  [global]  political  economy  are emphasised.  The analysis is divided into two major periods. The post-slavery adjustment era beginning from Haitian independence in 1804 to1914 [WWI] constitutes the first period, while the second  runs  between1914-1990.  Topics  include  Caribbean  agriculture  plantations  and  peasant  farms,  question  of  labour  and  labour  migration,  nationalist, reformist and revolutionary movements and political change, Caribbean social structure, foreign intervention and democracy and dictatorship.

## HIST2010:   THE HAITIAN REVOLUTION AND ITS LEGACIES IN GLOBAL CONTEXT

This course provides a comprehensive analysis of the Haitian Revolution in a global context. It is divided into three parts: (1) The  Haitian Revolution:  Core  Developments,  (2) Understanding the Revolution in Global Context, and (3) Legacies of the Revolution. Part I focuses  specifically  on  the  core  events  in  Saint  Domingue  (later  Haiti)  including  prerevolutionary  conditions,  the  1791  slave  uprising,  the  granting  of  emancipation,  and  the emergence of the Haitian nation. Part II explores how different regions of the world helped to shape the course of events in Saint Domingue. It also considers how the ideas of the

American, French, and Spanish American revolutions influenced people and conditions in the colony. Furthermore, it explores the initial reactions and consequences of the revolution in these areas. Part III examines the longer-term legacies of the revolution. It considers a number of important themes including slavery, anti-colonialism, and Black Nationalism. The course ends with a consideration of the memory of the revolution in the present day through an  examination  of  monuments,  social  movements,  current  perspectives,  and  recent scholarship. Throughout the course, students will be exposed to the substantial amount of primary source material available on the Haitian revolution and therefore develop skills in primary source analysis.

## HIST2018:   SPORT AND NATIONALISM IN THE CARIBBEAN

This  course  offers  a  comparative  analysis  of  socio-economic,  cultural  and  political structures within the Danish, Dutch, English, French and Spanish speaking territories of the Caribbean  region  developed  from  the  immediate  post-slavery  period  through  to  1990. Measures aimed at transforming these former slave/ plantation economies into modern nationalist  states  within  the  context  of  the  international  [global]  political  economy  are emphasised.  The analysis is divided into two major periods. The post-slavery adjustment era beginning from Haitian independence in 1804 to1914 [WWI] constitutes the first period, while the second  runs  between1914-1990.  Topics  include  Caribbean  agriculture  plantations  and  peasant  farms,  question  of  labour  and  labour  migration,  nationalist, reformist and revolutionary movements and political change, Caribbean social structure, foreign intervention and democracy and dictatorship.

## HIST2103:   LATIN AMERICA 1600 - 1870: FROM COLONIALISM TO NEO COLONIALISM

This  course  will  examine  how  the  Iberians  established  political,  economic,  cultural  and social  control  over  the  Americas,  and  how  this  domination,  exercised  through  religious, economic, administrative institutions, as well as by maturing concepts of inequality and racism was internalised or opposed by the "subject people". It will then discuss the limited objectives of the liberation movements in Latin America in the early 19th century, liberalism as  a  modernising  concept  and  simultaneously  as  a  force  for  the  establishment  of  new patterns of domination from Europe.

## HIST2104:    SOCIETIES AND ECONOMICS IN LATIN AMERICA FROM 1870

This course will begin with the response of Latin America to world economic expansion in the  late  19 th   century,  and  the  social  changes,  emerging  out  of  the  interaction  of  Latin America's  economies  with  international  economic  trends,  induced  rapid  urbanization, manufacturing capabilities, ideological change, social legislation, and the labour pains of incipient  labour  organization.  It  will  continue  with  the  attempt  by  Latin  Americans  to redefine their nationality in terms of indigenous tradition, and indigenous philosophies, and in  terms of Marxist analysis, socialist movements, and in terms of their response to US imperialism. The course will examine the long-term effort at import-substitution, industrialization, the problems encountered with that model, and the oil and debt crises of the 1980s onwards.

## HIST2203:   PEOPLES, WARS AND REVOLUTIONS: NORTH AMERICA 1600 to 1812

This course represents an attempt to broaden the view of 'America' to mean more than the United States of America. On the North American continent there were shared experiences

of contact between peoples, of wars, of revolutions, among other things, which call for a holistic approach rather than the peculiarist examination of the History of the United States.

## HIST2204:   FROM DEVELOPING TO 'DEVELOPED' NORTH AMERICA 1815 - 1980

This course will examine the meaning and processes of 'development'; to follow the social, political  and  economic  evolutions  in  the  emerging  nation-states  and  to  explore  the relationship between the United States and Canada.

## HIST2301:    THE STATE &amp; DEVELOPMENT IN AFRICA 1800 - 1900

The  course  examines  the  nature  of  the  indigenous  state  structures  and  economic development before going on to discuss the following themes: European occupation of Africa and the evolution of the colonial state; relations between the colonial state and the world religions - Islam and Christianity - as cultural forces of change; the colonial state and the economic reorientation of African societies - the abolition of domestic slavery, cashcropping monetisation and evolution of the factor-market in Africa.

## HIST2304:     THE STATE AND DEVELOPMENT IN AFRICA SINCE 1900

In the context of Africa's integration into the global capitalist system before the twentieth century, the course is primarily concerned with the role of the state - that is the colonial and postcolonial state- in Africa's socioeconomic and political development since 1900. It begins with the colonial state and its unbridled exploitation of Africa's human, material and cultural  resources  before  considering  the  postcolonial  state  and  its  capacity  to  initiate sustainable development in the continent within the framework of the present international division  of labour,  neo-colonialism,  and  the  forces  of  globalization  dominated  and championed by Africa's erstwhile European colonizers and their ideological allies.

## HIST2407:     EUROPE IN AN AGE OF REVOLUTIONS: 1789-1918

This  course  introduces  students  to  the  social,  cultural  and  political  changes  that transformed  Europe  over  a  long  nineteenth  century  extending  from  the  outbreak  of  the French Revolution to the Bolshevik Revolution/end of the First War. Over this period many long-established  social  categories  were  reframed:  'nation,'  'race,'  'class,'  religion  and gender  all  faced  radical  changes.  In  considering  how  three  very  different  revolutions  political,  industrial  and  agricultural  -  all  transformed  Europe  the  course  explores  the broader  shifts  in  the  understanding  of  social  relations  across  this  period  that  not  only transformed Europe, but also altered Europeans' relations with the Caribbean and the rest of the world.

## HIST2408:    INTRODUCTION TO MODERN JAPAN

The course is a survey of modern Japanese history. The focus is on the politico-economic transformations of the political regime since the seventh century although the emphasis is given to the modern and contemporary periods (mid-nineteenth century to the present). The course offers an in-depth and comprehensive analysis of political, economic and diplomatic issues that are prominent in the contemporary world. Students will have an opportunity to explore the political and economic modernisations, such as the development of democracy and  constitutionalism  and  industrialisation,  and  the  transforming  relationships  between Japan and its neighbours in the modern and contemporary periods.

## HIST2409:    EUROPE SINCE 1917

The shaping of ideas of 'Europe' is an ongoing historical process.  The aim of this course is to allow twenty-first century students in the Caribbean to grasp the varying impacts of the sweep of historical change across Europe's various societies - and, in the process, gain a broader  view  of  the  period  and  its  issues  that  will  allow  them  to  contextualize  specific elements in European history into broader contexts.  The course extends beyond a narrow focus on a few 'great' nations to consider both the wider experiences of smaller nations and those states that succeeded in maintaining their neutrality.  Instead of splitting the century's  experiences  on  either  side  of  the  Second  World  War  this  class  addresses  the origins of several current issues in European politics and societies to provide the students with  contexts  to  consider  the  current  revivals  of  exclusionary  nationalist  policies  and Russian interventionism.  In the process the course examines both the continuities and the divergences  between  the  first  and  second  halves  of  the  continent's  twentieth-century experiences.

## HIST2503:   HISTORY OF MODERN CHINA

The course is a comprehensive examination of the evolution of China from the seventeenth century to the present. Emphasis is placed on the broad  patterns of economic, political, social and cultural development; the importance of tradition; western intrusion; modernization and industrialization; the rise of nationalism and revolutionary movements leading to the communist victory in 1949.

## HIST2602:   IMPERIALISM SINCE 1918

An  analysis  of  the  historical  evolution  of  imperialism  since  World  War  I  including  the collapse of colonial empires and the advent of neo-colonialism. The economic and cultural consequences of imperial rule in the Third World and the forces contributing to the rise of nationalism and shaping the process of de-colonization will be examined.

## HIST2603:   THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY SINCE 1850

The course of study involves and examination of the factors facilitating the growth and development of the international economy from Free Trade to Bretton Woods with a survey of development since 1945. The history is divided into two periods viz 1850 - 1914 and 1945 - 1990. In each period major developments in labour, migration, movement of capital, technical innovations, trade and commercial policies, payments and monetary systems are discussed.

## HIST2719: HISTORICISING DESIRE: HUMAN SEXUALITY FROM THE KAMA SUTRA TO THE VICTORIANS

This  course  examines  in  historical  terms  the  various  cultural  representations,  social categories and interpretations of sexuality from the pre-modern (Kama Sutra] to the modern period (Victorian era]. The primary focus of the course is to contextualize the discourse on sexuality in specific periods while exploring the intersectionality of various backgrounds (Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas] and continuities of developments which continue to influence  present  day  societal  discussions  (the  role  of  sex,  heterosexual  vs.  nonheterosexual, reproduction, marriage, pornography). The course begins with an examination of key terms in sexology and a discussion of the historiographical basis for sexuality as a distinct  field  of  study  with  the  landmark  publications  by  Michel  Foucault  and  Thomas Lacqueur.  The  historiographical  basis  for  the  study  of  sexuality  gives  credence  for  its

application to various historical periods reflecting issues of race, class, gender, and the age of  individuals.  The  interpretations  of  sexuality  are  examined  within  various  historical contexts  to  account  for  its  biological  foundations  (the  body),  which  reinforced  cultural disparities along the lines of race, class, and gender.

## GGEO3332:   DISASTER MANAGEMENT

The course builds on basis concepts of geology, geomorphology, tectonics, oceanography and geophysics in relation to the study of natural hazards, with special reference to the Caribbean region. It examines hazards and risks related to volcanic and seismic activity, mass movement,  hydro-meteorological  phenomena,  and  coastal  hazards.  An  important focus  is  on  the  mapping  and  analysis  of  hazards,  vulnerability  and  risk.  The  course examines  theory,  hazards,  vulnerability,  response  capability,  risk  assessment,  disaster scenarios,  disaster  management,  preparedness,  prevention,  emergency  response,  and simulation.  It  covers  natural  hazards  and  related  anthropogenic  effects.  It  deals  with geotechnical and other approaches to natural hazard loss-reduction and management, as well  as  medical/health  aspects  of  natural  hazards  and  disasters.  Case  studies  and

examples of best-practice and failures in addressing disaster risk-reduction worldwide will be used to illustrate themes presented in the course.

## GEOG3333:   URBAN AND REGIONAL PLANNING

The first half of the course examines some of the basic concepts and debates underlying the field of urban and regional planning. Students are introduced to the history and evolution of  modern  town  planning,  various  planning  theories  and  procedural  models,  land  use management tools, and the complex and dynamic linkages that exist between planning processes and development. The second half of  the course entails a case study based analysis  of  different  planning  issues  affecting  modern-day  societies,  such  as  waster insecurity  and  sanitation,  financing  low-income  housing,  urban  safety  and  security,  the global urban energy crisis, and vulnerability to climate change. Case studies are drawn from a range of low and middle income countries, but with a special emphasis on the Caribbean.

## GGEO3334:   TROPICAL LAND MANAGEEMENT

The use and management of the land resource in the semi-arid, the seasonal wet-dry, and the humid tropics. An examination of the nature of tropical weathering and soil formation. An  explanation  of  why  tropical  soils  are  susceptible  to  the  processes  of  soil  and geomorphological degradation. A discussion of hazards associated with the human use of  tropical  soils,  such  as  irrigation  and  salinization,  soil  erosion  and  slope  failure,  and desertification, as well as the consequences of deforestation for land use. An examination of methods of soil modelling and management of land use problems. An examination of the implications of changing global climates for agriculture and food security in the tropics, as  well  as  the  nature  of  aid  and  policy  scenarios  for  the  alleviation  of  tropical  land degradation.

## ba CULTURAL AND CREATIVE INDUSTRIES (Major)

The Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Cultural and Creative Industries recognizes the key role of creativity  and  cultural  diversity  in  the  building  of  new  knowledge  economies.  It  also recognizes that the potential of artistic and creative outputs for wealth creation and income generation is best realized by individuals rooted in academic knowledge, trained in relevant competencies,  and  able  to  critically  assess  trends  and  developments  in  the  field.  This programme aims to enable students to meet this human resource need in the cultural and creative industries.

Students in the programme receive academic grounding in an area of their choice, while also  receiving  exposure  to  the  creative  industries,  and  developing  skills  in  conducting various aspects of sectoral operations. This is achieved through registration in courses in three  Concentrations  (formerly  referred  to  as  Clusters):  a  Disciplinary  Concentration,  a Fundamentals  Concentration,  and  a  multidisciplinary  Cultural  and  Creative  Industries Concentration. The programme is designed to be flexible and allow students to develop in myriad  different  directions  and  enable  them  to  enter  into  processes  of  convergence  of content, technology and business practices.

Students in the BA Cultural and Creative Industries programme must complete 24 credits for courses in the Fundamentals Concentration (CLTR courses), 24 credits in a Disciplinary Concentration, and 24 credits in a Cultural &amp; Creative Industries Concentration.

## BA music and performance studies

The B.A. in Music and Performance Studies is designed for students who have a strong passion  for  music  and  the  arts  but  do  not  wish  to  pursue  a  career  that  is  focused  on performance. Students are exposed to a range of academic thinking primarily based on musicological and ethnomusicological concepts with core courses in music theory, aural training and critical listening. Music courses range from introductory to advanced levels and although grounded in Western diatonic harmony, consider and explore culturally diverse methods of making, performing, producing and consuming music. A strong feature of the degree is the recognition of technology as a critical component in many spheres of the arts and  particularly  music,  which  increasingly  depends  on  a  wide  variety  of  software  and hardware platforms. Although the degree focuses on music and performance studies, the development  of critical thinking, reading and writing skills remain central in the development of a well-rounded scholar and UWI graduate.

The  three  (3)  years  of  study  include  a  foundation  year  that  immerses  the  student  in established concepts of music creation, performance, production, transmission, analysis and  research.  In  the  second  year,  many  of  the  introductory  themes  will  continue  at  an advanced level and the student will be exposed to a closer examination of musical practice in the context of the technology, culture and the societal forces that shape it. In the final year of study, course selection includes areas where the student will begin to specialize.

The general requirements for admission into the Faculty of Humanities and Education are applicable for the B.A. in Music and Performance Studies, however, one of the qualifying CSEC or CAPE subjects should be in the subject of Music or an equivalent Associated Board grade five in Music Theory.  Without a music qualification at CSEC or CAPE level, the student will be required to pass the mandatory MUSC0102: Introduction to Music Theory course during the first semester of study.

## Programme Structure and Content :

The Music and Performance Studies programme consists of three (3) concentrations:

- 1. Music and Performance Studies (Core Concentration)

## Course Descriptions

## Cultural studies

## CLTR1001:   INTRODUCTION TO THE STUDY OF CULTURE

Culture  is  thought  to  be  one  of  the  most  complicated  words  in  the  English  language. Disciplinary perspectives such as Anthropology, Sociology and Cultural Studies have sought to  understand  the  complexity  of  culture,  its  definition,  social  uses,  manifestation  and political  uses, especially its intersection with power and powerlessness. The course will explore  significant  connections  between  these  disciplines  through  an  exploration  of definitions and varied approaches to the study of culture. The course is divided into two parts  -  the  history  and  development  of  the  study  of  culture  (Pt.  I)  and  the  eventual metamorphosis into Cultural Studies (Part II).  This course is a foundation level one course to be completed by all students pursuing ICS Minors / Majors.

## CLTR1005:  MATERIAL CULTURE AND IDENTITY IN THE CARIBBEAN

The  course  engages  material  culture  as  a  political  force  where  issues  of  agency, commodification and consumption emerge. As is customary in cultural studies, this course draws  on  approaches  from  anthropology,  geography,  archaeology,  and  science  and technology as it explores the complex story of Caribbean culture through the objects made by humans. Truly interdisciplinary in nature, this course exposes students to culture through engagement and application of  theories  and  methods that  centre  attention  on  material culture  as  a  space  to  analyse  power  and  identity.  Emphasis  is  placed  on  interrogating agency,  representation  and  power  structures  in  the  appearances,  roles  and  histories  of material culture ranging from art, food, and dress, to landscapes, the built environment, religion and the collection of local/indigenous artefacts. Students are encouraged to start thinking critically about materials they encounter on a daily basis.

## CLTR1803:  INTRODUCTION TO CULTURAL AND CREATIVE INDUSTRIES

This course is designed to engender an appreciation of the practices and key terms relating to  Cultural  and  Creative  Industries  for  students  at  the  undergraduate  level.  It  provides students with a historical overview of the development of Cultural and Creative Industries, as well as an introduction to their specific practices, policies, processes and structures regionally and internationally. Contemporary and other emerging issues of relevance to the Cultural and Creative industries also form part of this course.

## CLTR1007:  ACCOUNTING FOR THE HUMANITIES I

This course provides non-specialist students with an introduction to the core principles of accounting and financial management relevant to Humanities enterprises. It stresses the role  of  accounting  as  a  service  activity  within  the  broader  industry  context.  The  course creates a foundation for further exploration of final accounting in Humanities enterprises.

## CLTR2007:  ACCOUNTING FOR THE HUMANITIES II

Building on knowledge previously gained in CLTR1007, the course guides students in their acquisition of technical and problem solving skills in the area of corporate external financial reporting, which comprises financial reporting by reporting entities to external stakeholders. Students in this course will gain skills in reading financial statements and understanding the procedures used to prepare them. They also learn how to use financial statements to analyse the economic status and performance of Caribbean Humanities enterprises.

## CLTR2018:  INTRODUCTION TO CARIBBEAN FOLK PHILOSOPHY

This course explores the concept of 'Folk Philosophy' as a Caribbean intellectual tradition developed and advanced by unlettered thinkers. It highlights the contribution of key agents in  establishing  discourses  on  New  World  being  and  the  interpretation  of  the  Caribbean experience since slave emancipation. These ideas are discussed in light of the national heroes, official and unofficial, as agents in the construction of a Caribbean Folk Philosophy. The  course  will  help  students  identify  the  key  sources  of  Caribbean  folk  philosophy, delineate its  inner  logic,  and philosophical  emphases and assess its contribution to the society.

## CLTR2020: INTRODUCTION TO ICONOGRAPHY

Iconography is the descriptive study of images that classifies and describes them from their representation, relating them to textual sources. This course is for students of film studies, cultural  studies,  history,  social  psychology,  media  and  communication  studies,  among others, and digital humanities more broadly. The most important aims of this course are that students understand images, how they convey meaning in unique ways, and that their visual  messages  can  be  decoded.  The  study  of  iconography  encompasses  a  variety  of methods used to identify the subject matter of a pictorial image, describe its contents, and analyze its utility in view of its original cultural context. The course covers some of the most important themes visualized in the arts by analyzing imagery spanning different periods, geographical regions, pictorial media, and artistic techniques. While special emphasis is placed on the intersections of art and literature, the course examines pictorial themes that are independent of a specific textual basis. This course will also address broader issues of visual  inquiry,  such  as  patronage,  viewer  response,  emotions,  and  gender  roles.  In  this course, students will acquire a 'visual literacy' that will enable them to explore all kinds of works of art fruitfully as primary sources in their own right and apply skills gained in an interdisciplinary context.

## CLTR2406:  THE CITY IN FILM

The course adopts an interdisciplinary approach in understanding how urban centres are represented in film and shape the cities in our imaginations. It explores the cinematic city as a place of cultural expression, as a site of diversity, displacement and social liberation, but also as a site of social control. Hence, the course examines the aesthetic, industrial, political, and  cultural  dimensions  of  the  city  in  film.  Students  will  study  cinematic representations  of  several  major  cities  with  an  emphasis  on  cities  in  the  global  south, exploring their depictions as sites of postcolonial struggle and migration. Students will also have the opportunity to critically explore male dominance in city films with attention given to the ways gender is constructed and performed across a range of genres.

## CLTR2501:  INTRODUCTION TO CARIBBEAN CULTURAL STUDIES

This course introduces students to theories of Cultural Studies generally and the terrain of Caribbean  Cultural  Studies  specifically.  It  highlights  the  main  cultural  practices  in  the Caribbean with particular emphasis on Jamaica, and relates them to the study of culture in general.  Students  are  expected  to  analyse  the  impact  of  race,  class  and  gender  as experienced in the Caribbean while assessing their significance as frames of reference for understanding  cultural  practices  and  power  relations.    The  course  offers  students  a platform  through  which  to  interpret  cultural  expression  in  its  broadest  political  sense. Students will be exposed to the leading intellectual interpretations of Caribbean culture.

## CLTR2505:  ENTERTAINMENT, MEDIA AND CULTURE

This course focuses on the operation of selected Caribbean cultural industry areas of the arts,  music,  live  and  media  entertainment,  among  others.    It  also  examines  the  basic concepts and principles that relate to the entertainment, media and culture industries, as well  as  the  various  aspects  of  the  cultural  industries  in  the  Caribbean,  including  their diversity  and  complexity.    It  appraises  the  international  context  and  the  impact  of globalization  on  Caribbean  cultural  products  and  contextualizes  the  regional  cultural industry.  Students are exposed to information that guides their assessment of the role of culture  in  the  entertainment  industry  in  general.    The  course  assesses  the  contribution cultural enterprises can make to the region and discusses its role in the region's economy and future.

## CLTR2506:  CARIBBEAN FILMS AND THEIR FICTIONS

The course introduces students to some of the classics of Caribbean cinema and three diverse examples of film practice in the region. The texts for this course provide unique examples of the close relationship between film and fiction across the three main linguistic areas of the Caribbean. Collectively, they provide a dynamic representation of Caribbean life and culture, through which students gain valuable insight into social issues and the culture and history of the region. The texts studied in the course are: Black Shack Alley by Joseph Zobel and Sugarcane Alley, directed by Euzhan Palcy; Inconsolable Memories by Edmundo Desnoes  and  Memories  of  Underdevelopment,  directed  by  Tomás  Gutieérez  Alea; The Harder  They  Come,  directed  by  Perry  Henzell,  and The  Harder  They  Come  by  Michael Thelwell.

## CLTR2518: THE CULTURE OF RASTAFARI

This course offers an introduction to some of the central ideas and issues related to the culture of Rastafari. The objective is to allow students to view a range of cultural artefacts and texts produced by and about Rastafari in order to interpret and assess the significance of the Movement's emergence, development and contribution to local sensibilities as well as global thought and practice.  Themes include key principles of Rastafari relative to postemancipation discourse, early patterns of resistance, social organization and the influence of Rastafari on popular culture.

## CLTR2519:  DECONSTRUCTING THE CULTURE OF SPORT

This  course  presents  sport  as  a  cultural  ground  for  analyzing  and  interpreting  human dynamics in teams, clubs, institutions, and by extension, the Nation. The course is designed

to  sensitize  students  to  the  psychological,  social,  economic  and  political  'forces'  that impact on the development of sport in the Caribbean, and the world in general. The course introduces students to theories of deconstruction, play, games and sport and their interrelationship with history, culture and society. Various sports such as horse racing, boxing, athletics, cricket, football, tennis and netball will be explored.

## CLTR2524:  AFRICAN RELIGIOUS RETENTIONS IN THE CARIBBEAN

This course examines the contribution of Africa and its people to some Caribbean religious expressions.  The course presents the dominant worldview of traditional African culture and explains a number of its concepts such as religion, superstition, spirit belief and syncretism as well as African cultural approaches to health and healing.  It explores African influenced religions  in  the  region  focussing  on  the  influence  of  African  culture  upon  Christianity. Classes are  structured  in  a  seminar  format  with  a  lecture  presentation,  followed  by  an opportunity given to participants to engage in discussion of key issues. Where necessary, videos are used to supplement the shared information.

## CLTR2705:   MUSIC BUSINESS MANAGEMENT

This course presents a broad overview of the recording and music industries, and explains how the  various  segments  operate  on  a  day-to-day  basis,  with  special  reference  to  the Jamaican music scene.  Students will learn about where monies are generated, who are the key industry players, how deals are made and broken, how to protect one's interests and how to exploit new developments in digital technology that are changing the way that music is marketed, promoted, distributed, and heard.  This course also introduces students to the career  opportunities  that  are  available  within  the  industry,  and  imparts  the  knowledge needed to achieve their goals.

## CLTR2803:  CULTURAL AND CREATIVE INDUSTRIES IN THE CARIBBEAN

This  course  is  designed  to  engender  an  understanding  of  the  Cultural  and  Creative Industries in the Caribbean. It provides students with a regional framework through which to define, analyse and assess Caribbean Cultural and Creative Industries (CCCI). The course also examines how the Caribbean Cultural and Creative Industries contribute to the global economy as well as how the said industries are developed by the regional governments. Contemporary  and  other  emerging  issues  in  the  said  industries  also  form  part  of  this course.

## LEVEL III

## CLTR3005:  FOOD AND CULTURE IN THE CARIBBEAN

This research-linked course utilises the interdisciplinary lens of Cultural Studies to engage with and examine the relationship between people/communities and food in the Caribbean. It addresses the role food plays in shaping culture and identity. The symbolic meaning and representation of food preparation in religion, rituals and beliefs are explored. It examines the role of memory and conscience in food choices, together with hegemonic forces such as  class,  gender  and  ethnicity  in  food  production,  preparation  and  consumption.  The cultural  construction  of  what  is  'indigenous',  'taboo',  'clean'  'pure',  'healthy'  and  'ital'  are examined. The place and role of food in sexuality, sustainable development, nation building, resistance and survivalist strategies, healing and wellness and globalisation are critically assessed.

## CLTR3070: THE SOUND SYSTEM: SONIC TECHNOLOGY AND CULTURE

This course examines the foundational role that the sound system played in inspiring and engendering a creative ethos which form the cultural and methodological bases for the Jamaican music industry. The sound system is a Jamaican cultural institution that has had a  fundamental  impact  on  the  development  postcolonial  Jamaican  cultural  identity.  It inspired the development  of  electronic sound  technology  in Jamaica  with  global implications and gave birth to Jamaica's recording industry also with global implications.

## CLTR3033:   REGGAE AESTHETICS AND AFRICAN DIASPORAN RESISTANCE

Through an examination of multi-textual representations (film, food, music, art and dance traditions) Reggae as an ethos and a Rastafari-inspired aesthetic of Caribbean discourses is engaged. It traces the development and creation of distinct African Diasporic aesthetics in terms of beauty, resistance and freedom. Through the lens of pre-colonial, colonial and post-colonial history, it explores the movement from African to African Diasporic aesthetics, critiques  and  identities.  The  course  therefore  explores  the  origins  of  Caribbean  and Diasporic  aesthetics,  philosophies,  discourses  and  the  cultural  and  creative  industries within  the  context  of  Reggae  and  Rastafari.  Students  are  guided  by  a  weekly  seminar through an array of  texts and  cultural  products  in  order  to  assess  the  contribution  and critique the works of the creative imagination within this frame. Semester I of the course will explore the development of specific African and Diasporic Aesthetics while Semester II of  the  course  will  focus  on  an  examination  of  multi-textual  representations  (film,  food, music, art and dance traditions) of African and Diasporic aesthetics through the lens of Reggae.

## CLTR3099 &amp; CLTR3098: CULTURAL AND CREATIVE INDUSTRIES CAPSTONES PARTS I &amp; II

This  course  builds  on  Levels  I  and  II  courses  while  bridging  the  gap  between  finalizing students and the wider industry. It is designed to develop an understanding of the CCIs in the Caribbean through a combined theoretical and professional perspective. It is a year-long capstone course that exposes students to practitioners in the CCIs throughout the year and will see students carrying out a research project in their second semester. CLTR3098 AND CLTR3099  will  meet  the  Faculty's  requirement  of  a  research-linked  course  and  is  a substitute for HUMN3099.   In this course, students are exposed to the major sectors of the CCIs and key players from the practitioners' and technical specialists' perspectives through interactive activities such as field trips, case study analyses and (guest) lectures. In Part I, students  interface  with  the  management,  operational  and  legal  tenets  as  well  as  best practices of sector professionals in the CCIs generally and in the Caribbean specifically. In Part II, students explore the philosophical, ideological, and strategic planning in the CCIs. Knowledge gained in this course provides students with crucial insights into the intellectual and professional strengths, and needs of the industries.

## CLTR3406:  DOCUMENTARY FILM

This  research-linked  course  is  designed  to  give  students  a  historical  and  theoretical understanding of documentary film as a non-fictional form of cinema. We will examine various  documentary  film  genres,  such  as  Cinéma  Vérité,  ethnographic  films,  and  the autobiographical documentary, focusing on landmarks films within each genre. The scope of this course is both global and historical in order to prompt students' thinking about the diverse roles documentaries have played across space and time

## CLTR3501:  DISCOURSES IN CULTURAL STUDIES

The  course  is  intended  to  introduce  students  to  the  expanse  of  the  Cultural  Studies disciplinary terrain, its methods of inquiry, its contribution and essential nature. This will be achieved  by  close  examination  of  the  process  of  institutionalization  and  the  spread  of Cultural  Studies  throughout  the  northern  and  southern  hemispheres.  From  its  original interests  in  working  class  cultures,  youth  subcultures  and  the  media,  and  using  the Birmingham  and  Frankfurt  Schools  as  a  sort  of  intellectual  and  historical  beginning, students  metaphorically  traverse  a  Cultural  Studies  map  of  practice  and  discourse. Students  will  study  both  the  methods  and  objects  of  Cultural  Studies  scholarship.  Key questions are answered, such as - How do we analyze popular and expressive cultural practices? What is the relationship between culture and economic or political structures? How  are  cultural  meanings  produced,  circulated  and  consumed?  How  do  cultural formations produce collective agency and individuated subjectivity? What is subculture? How we examine models of counter-culture? What is the relationship between the urban, performance and the body? What models of nation and/or community are to be found in the popular?

## CLTR3505:  THE ART OF ARTIST MANAGEMENT

This course is designed to instil the fundamental principles of effective artiste management, and seeks to equip students with the skills required to meet the numerous challenges faced by management in the Cultural and Creative Industries. The course will create  an  environment  for  students  to  investigate  the  management  skills  and  attitudes required to handle varied types of artists within the Cultural and Creative Industries locally, nationally, internationally and globally.

## CLTR3506:  AFRICAN DIASPORA FILM

From Spike Lee's Do The Right Thing, to Dancehall Queen, to Blaxploitation films, this course encourages students to consider Black films as more than simply entertainment. A rich and compelling subject for study, black  cinema  also  offers  contemporary  perspectives on a wide range of issues and concerns, including gender, race, culture and identity, exile and displacement, history and memory, rebellion and resistance. In this exciting new course students learn how to 'read' and analyse films, and consider how the elements of film form are manipulated to produce narratives on the screen. Students will also have the opportunity to explore different approaches to film making, and also examine the positioning of the black spectator in dominant cinema. Six films will be studied for the course and will be drawn  from  filmmaking  communities  in  the  Caribbean,  North  America  and  the  United Kingdom.

## CLTR3507:  CULTURE, GENDER &amp; SEXUALITY IN JAMAICAN POPULAR MUSIC

This research-linked course draws on theories at the juncture of gender and cultural studies, to  question  the  production  and  consumption  of  Jamaican  popular  music  culture  and critically examine the intersections of gender and sexuality therein. It explores the ways in which  Jamaican  popular  music  has  been  instrumental  in  mediating  constructions  both national and personal and how the creation, consumption, and understanding of culture are dependent on our often-unconscious assumptions regarding gender and sexuality. Thus, the course also signals how unequal power structures and stereotypical and oppressive role  models  can  be  revealed  and  challenged.  In  this  regard,  it  will  be  seen  how  culture shapes our perception of who we are (or who we are supposed to be) and how we behave

(or  how  we  are expected  to  behave).  The  course  will  focus  on  dancehall  music  as contemporary  popular  Jamaican  music,  but  will  also  draw  from  other  genres,  including reggae and mento.

## CLTR3508:   ISSUES IN CARIBBEAN CYBERCULTURE

The  course  examines  the  ways  in  which  new  media  technologies  in  a  digital  age  have changed  how  Caribbean  people  interact,  individually  and  collectively,  within  the  local, regional  and  international  spheres.  The  course  explores  the  impact  of  new  media technologies on the ways that we think, what we understand as truth, how we communicate, conceptualise  identity,  build  virtual  communities,  construct  nation  and  affect  political change. The course focuses on cyber reality, the internet's effects, new communication technologies,  and  new  modes  of  digital  production,  distribution,  and  consumption.

The  course  exposes  students  to literature covering the Anglophone, Francophone, Dutch and Hispanophone Caribbean on sexuality and its regulation. The course also acknowledges that bodies and sexualities are racialized  in  specific  ways  in  Caribbean  societies,  including  within  the  large  Asian populations. It explores the importance of sexuality as a 'power over life' issue influencing control  over  bodies,  hierarchy,  privilege  and  the  structure  of  Caribbean  society,  while examining the changes that are currently taking place both regionally and internationally.

## CLTR3516:  PERFORMING CULTURE: DANCEHALL AS RITUAL AND SPECTACLE

The  course  explores  select  facets  of  dancehall  culture  such  as  street  and  other performances,  its rituals and  celebration, alongside  the spectacle of fashion and masquerade,  and  the  video-light.  It  analyzes  how  these  can  be  understood  within  and beyond their everyday contextual framings and explores what these features tell us about the community and society in which they take place.  It examines elements of the everyday performance,  ritual  and  spectacle  that  characterize  the  'theatre'  of  dancehall  culture. Theories from performance studies, cultural studies and anthropology will be deployed to analyses of dancehall culture's rituals and spectacle.  Particular attention will be paid to the ways in which agency is created by actors from socio-cultural spaces of power from below.

This course is designed to critically assess the Rastafari worldview as an African Diasporan knowledge  system  on  the  world  stage.    The  course  examines  the  various  strategies employed by the Rastafari of Jamaica in globalizing its  culture  and  livity  and  what that suggests about the Movement and its journey, vision and message within the Jamaican and international  communities.    It  also  addresses  the  contribution  of  Rastafari  to  Pan Africanism  and  global  liberation  struggles  in  general  as  well  as  the  challenges  the Movement faces as it grows, and grows away from its core Jamaican locale.

## CLTR3530:    RASTAFARI WOMEN, PATRIARCHY AND GENDER JUSTICE

The  course  discusses  the  ideas  and  practices  that  marginalize,  exploit,  dominate  and downpress women in the broader society which inform relations between women and men within  the  Rastafari  movement.  The  course  also  highlights  the  exercise  of  agency  by Rastafari  women  in  challenging  patriarchy  and  expanding  the  emancipatory  vision  and mission  of  Rastafari.  The  course  also  provides  the  learning  space  to  examine  the challenges that Rasta women or sistren have been posing to patriarchal relations within the movement, the nature of the gender justice-informed prescriptive ideas (solutions) that they are offering and to locate their struggles within the broader context of the women's and feminist  movement  within  the  Caribbean  and  elsewhere  across  the  world.   The  course equips  learners  with  the  knowledge,  skills  and  attitude  to  work  in  solidarity  with  Rasta women or sistren and progressive Rasta men or bredrin to advance the cause of gender justice and women's liberation within the Rastafari movement.

Such knowledge is foundational to future professionals in the field of music, whether they  work  as  adjudicators,  conductors,  composers,  arrangers,  performers,  or  teachers. Thus, pieces of music representative of each era will be selected to demonstrate musical traits  that  characterize the  periods  of  music  history  being studied.  Both  musical  scores (hence the pre-requisite) and listening extracts will be examined.

## LEVEL II

## MUSC2001:   POPULAR MUSICS OF THE CARIBBEAN

Today,  while  there  is  no  mistaking  Jamaican  reggae,  or  the  steel  pan  from  Trinidad  &amp; Tobago, there remains some confusion among less well-known though equally important Caribbean popular genres, even among local populations. Using the methods of musicology and ethnomusicology, the course will explore the evolution and characteristics of different popular music genres in the multilingual Caribbean region.

## MUSC2007:   RECORDED SOUND IN JAMAICAN POPULAR MUSIC

The  course  offers  a  historical  perspective  on  the  development  of  Jamaican  recording studios,  discussing  how  musical  performances  are  captured,  as  well  as  how  recorded sound influences the process of music creation. The emergence of new music and sounds, evident in some forms of mixing, turntableism and controllerism will be considered in the context of technology, culture and economics that continually drive the development of popular music. The development of the Jamaican recording industry will be discussed, as will  the  way  in  which  recording technology has been adapted to satisfy a range of local needs, and the emergence of the 'Jamaican sound'.

The theory of jazz musical structures will be related to a broad palette of jazz performance practice,  encompassing a number of important eras, subgenres, styles, their associated performers  and  their  geographical  origins.  Although  the  course  is  focused  on  the development of Jazz in the twentieth century, it will be delivered in the context of a wide range of art and popular music that continues to have relevance. The course content and examination are centered on aural analysis and therefore require the student to develop a theoretical and practical understanding of the subject matter.

## MUSC2041:   CARIBBEAN HAND DRUMMING

This  course  introduces  students  to  hand  drumming  and  the  rich  historical  and  sociopolitical tradition of this instrument in the Caribbean.

Examples will be drawn from film, broadcasting, sound recordings, gaming and social  media  that  demonstrate  the  importance  of  dissonant  and  consonant  sound  as  a critical purveyor of time, space, mood and sensibility. The capture, editing and production of sound will be discussed and the way in which the traditional roles of sound editor, sound designer, dialogue editor, sound effects editor, Foley recordist, and ADR recordist are now applied to a broad range of creative media forms. The principles of sound recording will be studied and how sound effects/treatments can be created by manipulating sound through synthesis, and the application of digital audio processing and editing software. The course will therefore require the student to engage in both the theory and practice of the subject.

## MUSC2052: MUSIC AND THE MOVING IMAGE

This course introduces students to the concept of music as a creative element that is found in a wide range of media from film to gaming.  Students will be introduced to the historical connection  between  music  and  the  visual  arts  including  opera,  dance,  theatre,  cinema, television and animation. The course will discuss key concepts and theories essential in the synchronization of music and wide array of moving images including: diegetics, composing and/or selecting library music as the thematic elements in the development and support of a visual narrative, the creation of background and incidental music commonly found not only in television dramas and documentaries, but also animation, gaming, social media and advertising.  The  course  will  consider  how  fundamental  musical  components  such  as timing,  pace,  timbre,  tonality,  rhythm,  pitch  and  dynamic  can  be  interpreted  through nationally and regionally relevant sounds that enhance the commercial viability of a wide range of creative products. The student will therefore be required to develop a process of critically  assessing music,  and  demonstrate the ability to appropriately select/compose, edit  and  synchronize  sound  and  moving  image.  The  course  will  discuss  music  as  an emotive element with the potential to challenge or support stereotype perspectives, often grounded in the cultural and sociological value-systems that genres and performance styles can represent. The course can accommodate students with and without a technical musical background focusing on the manipulation of music in the digital domain.

## MUSC2100:   COMPOSING IN CARIBBEAN POPULAR GENRES (Cave Hill)

Composing, which is taken to include arranging and improvising, has become an integral part of music programmes in schools and tertiary institutions in many countries. It provides opportunities for personal exploration and inventiveness and allows for the development of a repertoire of music that speaks specifically to the aesthetic interests of contemporary society. This course seeks to develop skills and interests in composing. It also aims to foster an experience of the process of composing and thereby allows students to personally contribute to the development of Caribbean popular music as composers/performers and as an informed audience.

## MUSC2140: FUNDAMENTAL SKILLS IN AURAL WORK II

This  course  builds  on  MUSC1140  Fundamental  Skills  in  Aural  Work  I  and  requires competency in reading musical notation and the foundational tenets of music theory.  The course engages students in sight singing, interval, scale and chord recognition, and the identification of cadences using both major and minor keys up to four sharps and two flats. In  addition,  common  rhythmic  and  melodic  patterns  are  introduced  using  simple  and compound time signatures in major and minor keys, which the student is required to notate. Students  will  be  encouraged  to  develop  discipline  and  self-management  of  practice performance and study skills.

## MUSC2200:   A HISTORY OF JAZZ AND THE BLUES

Jazz and the Blues have occupied a significant place in the cultural history of the Americas for  over  a  century.  This  dual  music  genre  is  universally  recognized  as  an  important contribution  from  an  enslaved  people  to  the  cultural  inventory  of  the  planet,  and  is acknowledged for its distinctive impact on other music genres and art forms worldwide. This course surveys the histories of this genre from c.1619 up to 2000. It exposes students to the geography of Jazz/Blues, its structure and nature, the cultural and political influences that have helped to shape its evolution, its fusion with other art forms and styles of music inside and outside of the Caribbean, the role of gender and religion in its formation, and its modern manifestations. The course thus introduces students to an important aspect of the cultural  history  of  the  Americas,  enables  them  to  appreciate  the  genius  of  an  exploited people, and sensitizes them to better understand the musical contours of the present global age.

## MUSC2210: STEPPIN RAZOR: PETER TOSH REGGAE REBEL

This course will examine Tosh's post-Wailers career as a solo artist, with a focus on his decision  to  use  music  as  a  mechanism  of  protest/activism  for  equal  rights,  justice, legalization of ganja, and the promotion of black pride.  The course will also explore the way in which these themes are represented in his repertoire, writings, concerts, interviews and lifestyle.  The course will introduce     students to the concept of reggae as a rhetorical vehicle for Tosh's socio-political views and examine the way in which instrumentation, style, genre, text and form are manipulated as forces of African-centered desires and activism.

This course will provide students with an appreciation and understanding of Tosh and his music, but also provide the groundwork upon which to build a solid understanding of AfroCaribbean culture and black consciousness on a whole.  Tosh's work will be examined from a  musical  perspective  and  also  within  the  context  of  black  consciousness,  while  also looking at leaders in this area, such as Marcus Garvey.

## LEVEL III

## MUSC3002:   THE PRODUCTION OF POPULAR MUSIC

This course investigates how  writing, arranging, performance,  sound capture and commercial exploitation, are brought together as critical elements of the music production process. Although the course takes a broad view of music production, there is a focus on Jamaican popular music through  the  evaluation  of  local  sound  and  identifying  ways  in

which music production has been influenced by, but has also influenced, music from the rest  of  the  Caribbean  and  diverse  geographical  locations.  Music  production  models associated with North America and Europe will be analysed and discussed, providing a context for the production methodologies, which were adapted, but also expanded for the creation  and  capture  of  Jamaican  popular  music.  This  will  include  the  earliest  mento recordings of the 1950s, to the most recent computer based, digital recordings.

## MUSC3040: MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS AND SONIC CULTURES OF THE BLACK ATLANTIC

This course introduces students to the material culture of musical instruments, their design, and function within performance and symbolism, to the social and cultural values of the Black Atlantic and the Americas, with a special focus on the lived experience of Caribbean people. It will provide a historical overview of African instruments and their adoption and adaptation in the new world. The course content will examine the wide range of forces that influence  instrument  design  and  how  they  are  classified.  Musical  instruments  will  be investigated as socially constructed, material objects, but also complex metaphors which permit the construction, contestation, and negotiation of meaning and identity.

## MUSC3060: MUSIC COMPOSITION

This  course  offers  the  music  student  a  compendium  of  techniques  and  approaches towards the assessment and practice of musical composition. The concepts covered in the course are broad ranging and can be applied to several styles that include but are not limited to modal jazz, traditional Caribbean, and contemporary popular music. The student will be required to analyse and assess recorded compositions in the context of their theoretical principles and form creative templates using their own ingenuity and imagination to develop original musical works.

## MUSC3072: MENTO: ART, CULTURE AND POLITICS

The course introduces students to the foundations of Jamaican popular music through its first popular genre mento. The course explores how to analyse the captured representation in a sound recording as "text."

## MUSC3300:   BOB MARLEY &amp; HIS MUSIC

This seminar course will enable students to think about and interpret Marley's music in relation to a variety of theoretical, social, and cultural issues. Themes taken from aspects of his life and/or music will form the basis of discussions. Listening to recordings will be an  integral  part  of  the  teaching  and  learning  activities.  The  seminar  format  will  foster intellectual independence in students and promote critical and creative thinking.

## BA LANGUAGES AND LINGUISTICS  (SPECIAL)

Foreign language study is naturally allied to the field of Linguistics. The Special in Languages and Linguistics is intended to produce graduates who can work in international organisations and global  contexts  with  the  advantage  of  knowledge  of  one  or  more  Modern  and/or  Caribbean vernacular languages, as well as their contexts of use and communicative value. The programme is  a  combination of Modern languages, Caribbean languages such as English, Haitian Creole, Jamaican  Creole  and  Caribbean  Sign  Language,  with  Linguistics  courses  in  the  structure  of language (Phonology and Syntax, up to the advanced level).

The Special in Language and Linguistics requires a minimum of 66 credits.

## BA PHILOSOPHY

No other discipline but Philosophy allows for such sustained reflection on the ideas and issues which move individuals and groups of individuals in all human societies. Courses in the  Philosophy  programme  address  issues  pertaining  to  ethics,  human  existence  and experience, the value of cultural knowledge, the meaning of notions that we take for granted such as 'truth,' 'reason,' 'beauty,' 'right', 'duty', 'love', 'sex', 'identity', 'meaning/end of life',  'existence', 'God', etc. Critical reflection is at the core of the programme, allowing students to graduate with the tools to excel in a wide range of professions which call for an investigative mind either as employer, employee or self-employed entrepreneur.

Core subjects include African Philosophy, Caribbean Philosophy, Ethics, Logic, Epistemology, Philosophy of Mind and Metaphysics. Additionally, students will choose from a wide range of courses on topics such as Ancient and Modern Philosophy, Meaning of Life and Existence, Political Philosophy, Paradox Analysis, Philosophy of Religion, Philosophy of Law, Philosophy of Leadership, Philosophy of Sex and Love.

To qualify for a Major in Philosophy, students must complete a minimum of 39 credits in the discipline; 12 credits each at Levels I and II, and 15 credits at Level III of the programme.

Graduates  of  the  B.A  Philosophy  may  be  considered  for  acceptance  into  the  M.A  or M.Phil/PhD Philosophy programmes.

## Course Descriptions

## LANGUAGE COURSES

## LEVELS II AND III

## LANG2001:   LANGUAGE AND ETHICS

Ethical  issues  are  inherent  in  writing  and  speaking,  which  can  influence  others  either positively or negatively. This course introduces students to the ethical considerations which affect language use.  It provides an overview of theories of ethics, notions of personal and public ethics and issues of ownership such as plagiarism and copyright, as these relate to writing  and  research.  Ethical  and  unethical  arguments  are  examined  and  restructured. Ethical considerations in the language of national and international politics and communication across cultures are also addressed.

## LANG2003: CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF COMMUNICATIVE EVENTS

Preparing for a degree involves working with communicative events for the purposes of information  gathering,  knowledge-making  and  communication.  Hence,  competence  in processing  communicative  events  is  of  paramount  importance  to  every  student.    This course will assist students in all disciplines in investigating, understanding, and explaining communicative events in their environment and the reasons for specific responses to those events.

## LANG3001:   THE ART OF PUBLIC SPEAKING

The  purpose  of  this  course  is  to  provide  students  with  skills  in  the  preparation  of  oral presentations with an emphasis on the delivery - that is, the choice and use of appropriate language,  the  proper  use  of  the  voice  (including  elocution,  pronunciation,  and  voice projection) and the employment of visual aids.  Students will make frequent presentations, using a variety of discourses, which demonstrate their ability to think critically, to operate within different contexts, to be sensitive to their audience, and to take into consideration ethical concerns when preparing and delivering speeches.

## LANG3003:   TECHNICAL WRITING

This course is designed for students who wish to develop the ability to design, write and produce  technical  documents  for  different  organizations,  intended  for  communication within the organization, with other organizations and with the public - operations manuals, company ethics  code,  safety  manuals,  manufacturing  guidelines,  operating  procedures, employees' reports, product reports, etc. The course will address practical skills through its focus on research methods, working in a collaborative technical writing environment, and writing for different media.  It will also consider audience, legal principles and cross-cultural issues.

## LANG3101 COMMUNICATION IN THE WORKPLACE: PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE (formerly Business Communication/Organisational Communication)

This  course  is  designed  to  promote  students'  understanding  and  appreciation  of  the principles, processes and products of business communication; and to develop students' skills in transnational, informational and persuasive correspondence in a variety of business applications.

## LINGUISTICS COURSES

<!-- image -->

## LING1001:   INTRODUCTION TO PHONETICS AND PHONOLOGY

The first section of this course introduces the study of articulation (articulatory phonetics), including the details of the vocal apparatus and how it is used  to produce speech. The course introduces the International Phonetic Alphabet and teaches how its symbols can be used to provide an accurate representation of the sounds of language. It also considers how speech analysis software helps in the understanding of speech. In the second section of the course, we study how languages differ in their selections of speech sounds from among  the  full  range  of  possibilities  in  the  world.  We  also  discover  how  syllables  are organised, and how stress and tone may be used in languages.

## LING1002:   INTRODUCTION TO MORPHOLOGY AND SYNTAX

The first section of this course introduces the study of morphemes, the smallest parts of words that contribute to meaning. Students learn how words are formed through processes such  as  inflection,  compounding  and  reduplication.  The  second  section  of  the  course considers the rules of syntax: rules by which words are combined into phrases, forming the hierarchical  structures  which  produce  sentences.  Students learn  to  apply  tests  such  as replacement and movement, and to recognize the application of syntactic processes such as passivization and question formation.

## LING1003:   ESSENTIALS OF ENGLISH GRAMMAR

This course will deepen students' understanding of English as a global language and its role in  cross-cultural  communication.  It  is  intended  to  enhance  understanding  of  the  unique characteristics of Jamaican English and other Caribbean Englishes, while also developing students'  English  language  competencies  and  ability  to  communicate  across  different Englishes. The course includes hands-on practice in the analysis of English, as used by Jamaican speakers and by speakers in other regions of the world.

## LING1401:   INTRODUCTION TO LANGUAGE &amp; LINGUISTICS

This introductory course will have students examine questions such as 'what is language?', 'what is human communication?' and 'how is language used in society?' A glimpse into sentence structure will give a new perspective on ideas learnt in school about grammar. A study  of  the  relationships  between  language  and  society  will  open  students'  eyes  to variation in language. Consideration of the utterances of infants will reveal how knowledge and use of language develops in children. The identification of areas of the brain controlling various  functions  of  speech  will  provide  an  explanation  of  some  of  the  ways  in  which individuals can suffer language deficiencies.

## LING1402:   INTRODUCTION TO LANGUAGE STRUCTURE

This  course  provides  an  introduction  to  the  study  of  language  structure,  and  will  help students see that variation in language is limited, despite differences between languages. It considers how the vocal apparatus is used to produce speech sounds and how individual languages  use  sounds  to  differentiate  words.  Students  also  learn  how  words  can  be analyzed  to  consist  of  smaller  meaningful  parts  called  morphemes,  how  these  can  be classified by their function in language, and how words are formed through processes such as  inflection,  compounding,  reduplication.  Finally,  the  course  considers  how  words  are combined to form hierarchically structured phrases and sentences.

LING1402 compresses some of the subject matter of LING1001 and LING1002 in a single course. For a fuller understanding, it is recommended that those two courses are taken instead. LING1402 should NOT  be taken alongside either LING1001 or LING1002.

## LING1403:   INTRODUCTION TO LANGUAGE FOR TEACHERS OF LANGUAGE

This  course  is  designed  for  the  teacher  of  language  in  the  Caribbean.  The  basics  of phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax and semantics will be covered. The course also introduces  students  to  issues  concerned  with  language  variation,  criteria  for  describing language situations, attitudes towards languages and the function of particular languages in a speech community. Teachers will be given the basic tools to provide preliminary formal and  functional  analyses  of  the  speech  communities  from  which  their  students  come, introducing  the  teacher  to  issues  which  they  will  be  invited  to  consider  as  they  make pedagogical choices in literacy and language teaching.

## LING1801:   BEGINNERS' HAITIAN (NOT CURRENTLY OFFERED)

Haitian is one of the major Creole languages in the Caribbean. It is spoken by more than nine million persons and is among the few Creole varieties that have gained official status. In this course, students will have an opportunity to acquire a basic facility with oral and written expression and comprehension in Haitian.  They will also be exposed to a range of French-lexicon Creole texts, both written and oral, and the lyrics of popular Kweyòl music. A deliberate effort will be made to provide students with exposure to the major dialects of Haitian. This course has replaced LING2801 Structure and Usage of French Lexicon Creole

## LING1819:   BEGINNERS' CARIBBEAN SIGN LANGUAGE

The  languages  of  Deaf  communities  represent  important  linguistic  minorities  in  the Caribbean.  This  course  aims  to  expose  students  to  communication  in  Jamaican  Sign Language, a language which makes use of a visual-gestural mode. Students will acquire basic  conversation  skills,  and  beginners'  level  insights  in  the  structure  of  the  language. Jamaican Sign Language is largely mutually intelligible with other Sign Languages of the Anglo-Caribbean  region.  This  course  has  replaced  LING2819  Structure  and  Usage  of Caribbean Sign Language I.

<!-- image -->

## LING2001:   PHONOLOGY

This course, building on basic concepts introduced in LING1001 or LING1402, focuses in more detail both on articulatory phonetics, acoustic phonetics, and on the theories which seek  to  account  for  the  phonological  systems  of  human  language.  Using  a  Generative theoretical approach, it examines how we can understand phonological rules, the structure of syllables, and phenomena such as stress, tone and intonation in languages. It also equips students with the tools to analyse dialectal characteristics of English as spoken in different regions of the world.

## LING2002: SYNTAX

This course, building on basic concepts introduced in LING 1002 or LING1402, examines the  principles  which  underlie  syntactic  structure,  and  develops  a  model  which  explains structural relations and syntactic processes. It explores constituency, X-bar theory, Binding, Case  theory  and  Theta  theory,  to  develop  an  understanding  of  the  general  principles applicable to any language in the analysis of its structure.

## LING2004:   SEMANTIC THEORY (NOT CURRENTLY OFFERED)

This  course  provides  an  introduction  to  the  study  of  meaning  in  natural  languages.  It examines  basic  concepts  such  as  sense  and  reference,  meaning  relations  including polysemy and hyponymy, the relationship between meaning and structure and semantics versus pragmatics.

## LING2006: SPEECH AND HEARING SCIENCE

This course introduces students to the physiological basis and acoustics of speech and hearing,  equipping  them  with  a  knowledge  of  the  properties  of  sounds  with  specific reference the speech and hearing mechanisms. Students will be expected to acquire an understanding of how the various properties of a sound wave influence its character and its perception by the hearer. In addition, the ability of the articulatory apparatus to generate and  modify  sound  waves  will  be  considered  as  well  as  the  variation  brought  about  by different factors including gender, age, language and dialect. Students will also be exposed to clinical applications of this knowledge in the management of communication disorders as well as applications in the field of linguistics.

## LING2102:   LANGUAGE LEARNING AND TEACHING (NOT CURRENTLY OFFERED)

This  course  explores  approaches  to  the  learning  and  teaching  of  second  and  foreign languages across the world, with special emphasis on the sociolinguistic context of the Caribbean. It also discusses developments in Applied Linguistics and their applicability to language teaching and testing in the Caribbean context.

## LING2104:   EARLY LANGUAGE ACQUISITION IN A CREOLE-SPEAKING ENVIRONMENT

This course introduces the general processes of first and second language acquisition. It then  turns  to  the  acquisition  of  a  first  language  by  children  born  into  Creole-speaking communities and its relation to the acquisition of English as a second language in such an environment. This provides a basis for discussions of the real-world implications for the acquistion of English by children in the pre-Primary and Primary language arts classrooms and for the teaching of English in this context.

## LING2105:  LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT AND LANGUAGE LEARNING DISABILITIES

This  course  offers  an  introductory  survey  of  the  range  of  communication  disorders, including speech, language and hearing disorders. The course will equip participants with a basic  understanding  of  these  conditions,  and  their  symptoms,  to  be  able  to  take  the appropriate identification measures, to make referrals, and assist in intervention strategies. This course targets parents, social workers, nurses, educators, and undergraduate students who are or will be teachers/researchers/consultants in language development.

## LING2204:   DEAF LANGUAGE AND CULTURE

Many persons assume that the social norms of the Deaf are the same as those of the hearing. As this is not so, students need to be aware of and be able to appreciate the cultural differences  that  exist.  This  course  explores  the  cultural  experiences  and  perspectives among persons who are Deaf. In addition, the course provides an overview of issues related to members of the Deaf community.

## LING2301:   THE SOCIOLOGY OF LANGUAGE

This  course  covers  the  full  range  of  types  of  language  situations,  including  bilingual, multilingual,  diglossic  and  Creole  continuum.  It  looks  at  the  range  of  functions  that particular languages can perform in a speech community, for example, official, standard, private, public, etc. and examines, as well, how language attitudes are formed. The entire course is supported by references to case studies from language situations around the world.

## LING2302:   SOCIOLINGUISTICS

The course is fundamentally an exploration of the ways language can be studied as a social phenomenon, and focuses on developing an objective understanding of the links which speakers  make  between  language  and  social  groupings.  The  course  will  examine  the connection  between  specific  language  features  in  speech  communities  such  as  the pronunciation of 'r' and the social background of the speaker who uses the feature. Other topics  include  sociological  and  social  psychological  explanations  for  language  use, language change, language and gender, and language ideology. This course has a strong Caribbean focus.

## LING2402:   STRUCTURE OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE

This course reviews basic grammatical concepts and terminology in order to develop an understanding of the structure of English. The course will cover thematic variants of the kernel clause as well as clause/sentence type, among others. It investigates concepts of standardness and correctness and aims to give students a solid understanding of English sentence structure.

## LING2501:   LANGUAGE, GENDER AND SEX

The course focuses on the relationship between language and sex as a biological category versus  gender  as  a  social  phenomenon.  It  investigates  the  application  to  Caribbean language use of some of the theoretical frameworks through which this relationship has been studied. Also discussed are the ways children acquire gendered language identities and  issues  relating  to  sexism  in  language.  Actual  conversations  are  recorded  and transcribed for analysis. This course has a strong Caribbean focus.

## LING2604:   THE LANGUAGE OF POPULAR MUSIC IN THE ANGLOPHONE CARIBBEAN

This course will examine how the Creole and standard languages spoken in Caribbean, as well  as  the  language  varieties  intermediate  between  them,  are  used  in  commercially produced popular music lyrics across the decades from the 1950s into the 21st century. It will focus on mapping the patterns of language choice on to a series of other features, i.e. the musical genres, the topics, the guises the performers adopt,  and the particular time period.  The course will explore the ways in which music and the associated technologies provide Caribbean Creoles with the means to become international languages. The course also trains students to answer questions by way of actual research of samples of the music lyrics.

## LING2807:   INTRODUCTION TO GARIFUNA  (NOT CURRENTLY OFFERED)

This  is  another  in  a  series  of  courses  offering  students  exposure  to  a  living  Caribbean language. This is an introduction to one of the few Arawakan languages still spoken in the Caribbean,  Garifuna  as  spoken  by  the  Garinagu  or  'Black  Caribs'  of  Belize.  It  will  give students the ability to engage in conversational use of the language while exposing them to the structure of the language, including its similarities to other Arawakan languages. This will take place in a context where the student learns to appreciate the sociocultural norms associated with an indigenous Caribbean language.

## LING2810:   INTRODUCTION TO THE STRUCTURE AND USAGE OF JAMAICAN CREOLE

This course gives insight into the history, linguistic structure and usage of Jamaican Creole, helping students to see it as a language in its own right. Orthography, literature and lexicon are some of the areas that will be covered. The course will also consider the strategies that need to be employed to take Jamaican Creole outside of its traditional domains of use, developing projects around its use for purposes such as news reading, the presentation of health care information, etc.

## LING2811:   LEGAL TERMINOLOGY IN JAMAICAN CREOLE (NOT CURRENTLY OFFERED)

The background to any preparation of Jamaican language interpreters for the legal system requires familiarity with the appropriate technical legal terminology in Jamaican Creole. Building on the basis of the insights developed in LING2810, it is this need which this course seeks to fulfill.

## LING2820:   STRUCTURE AND USAGE OF CARIBBEAN SIGN LANGUAGE II

This  course  is  aimed  at  enhancing  the  receptive  and  expressive  sign  language  skills  of students, including the expression of abstract concepts in the sign language. It will also introduce students to more advanced aspects of the cherology, morphology and syntax, particularly nonmanual behaviours and classifiers of a Caribbean Sign Language.

## LING2821:   SIGN LANGUAGE FOR MEDICINE AND DENTISTRY

This course is designed for students in the Faculty of Medical Sciences entering the Clinical Practice phase of their training and is intended to specifically address the management of Deaf patients. LING2821 provides an opportunity to learn signs for the healthcare domain and to obtain fluency by practicing the use of sign language in immersion-type settings.

## LING2901:   COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS (NOT CURRENTLY OFFERED)

This course  explores  the  objectives of and  reasons  for  research  in the area of computational  linguistics.  It  introduces  students  to  the  difficulties  and  limitations  of  a computational approach to linguistic problems. It also addresses computational procedures and programming languages, from the perspective of the linguist. The highpoint of the course is the application of computational techniques to a problem in linguistics.

## LING2920:   INTRODUCTION TO THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF TRANSLATION

This course presents the fundamental theories of translation as outlined by the various schools of thought on the subject. In seeking to broaden the knowledge base of the student of linguistics and foreign languages, it highlights that translation is far more than simply changing  words  in  one  language  to  words  in  another  language.  Students  develop  an awareness  of  what  is  required  to  effectively  produce  a  new  text  which  conveys  the meanings contained in the original text.

## LEVEL III

## LING3001:   ADVANCED PHONOLOGY

This course  combines  theory  and  practice.  On  the  theoretical  side,  it  covers  the representation  of  segments  and  auto-segments,  phonological  rule  types,  the  syllable, metrical phonology, and markedness. On the practical side, it includes hands-on experience in  the  use  of  speech  processing  software  and  shows  how the software can be used to develop a deeper understanding of the acoustic properties of speech.

## LING3002:   ADVANCED SYNTAX

This course continues the study of syntactic structure, progressing seamlessly from work covered in LING2002. The course investigates ways in which properties of human language are explained within a theoretical framework and emphasizes that data are meaningless in the absence  of  a  theory.  Using  a  Transformational  Generative  model,  the  course investigates  how  to  account  for  transformations  such  as  head-to-head  movement  and phrasal movement, and crucially, the restrictions on movement. This is presented as a fairly complete and simple system, laying the theoretical foundation for further explorations.

## LING3201:   CARIBBEAN DIALECTOLOGY

This course takes an in-depth look at the sociohistorical background and development of Caribbean languages: indigenous languages of the Caribbean (in particular Arawakan and Cariban  languages),  the  languages  which  were  brought  to  the  region  under  colonialism (European,  African  and  Asian  languages)  and  the  Creole  languages  which  arose  in  the plantation societies and maroon societies of the region. In addition to a detailed analysis of the historical backdrop to contemporary Caribbean language situations, the course also considers the extent of our knowledge of the grammars of these languages.

## LING3202:   CREOLE LINGUISTICS

This  course  examines  the  validity  of  the  term  'Creole,'  and  looks  at  the  world-wide distribution of Creole languages. It aims to familiarize students with the debates on Creole genesis  and  Creole  typology  that  have  dominated  the  study  of  these  languages  and  to

engage them in a critical evaluation of the positions held by different sides in these debates. It  goes  on  to  look  at  the  phenomenon  of  decreolisation  in  the  context  of  theories  of language change.

## LING3303:   DISCOURSE ANALYSIS

This course introduces students to Discourse Analysis with a focus on conflict talk, both around  the  world  and  in  Jamaican  and  Caribbean  contexts.  It  explores  theoretical approaches to the analysis of spoken discourse such as the inferential, interactional and code approaches, and has students apply them to the analysis of their real-life recordings. A key aspect of the course involves students collecting, transcribing and coding spoken discourse.

## LING3304:   THE LANGUAGE OF NEGOTIATION

This course focuses on the practical aspects of language use in negotiation. It examines the communication processes involved in negotiation and covers both the basic principles and the practice of negotiation. It analyses language use in negotiation through role play and simulation and uses these to examine models and methods of negotiation; persuasive strategies; negotiator characteristics and styles; power and gender issues and social and cultural issues in negotiation.

## LING3399:   LANGUAGE PLANNING

This course analyses the links between language and national identity, and also deals with the  role  of  language  in  official  communication  networks.  Against  this  background,  it analyses the various kinds of efforts made to plan language and which consciously affect its use in human society, especially in relation to Caribbean Creole speech communities and the various current developments in language policy in Caribbean societies such as Haiti, Suriname, St. Lucia, Dominica, and Jamaica. Finally, this course aims at giving students practical experience related to Language Planning or the development of the resources of languages for official use. This will be done via small research projects, which students would select in consultation with the course lecturer.

## LING3701:   FIELD METHODS IN LINGUISTICS (NOT CURRENTLY OFFERED)

This course introduces the student to basic research methods in linguistics. Equipped with this knowledge, students are required to design their own programme of field research and go  into  the  field,  under  supervision,  to  collect  language  data  from  informants.  They  are required to transcribe portions of this data and provide some preliminary analysis.

## LING3819:   ADVANCED CARIBBEAN SIGN LANGUAGE

Building on the Level II courses, this course is designed to help students expand vocabulary and develop language skills and conversational fluency. Specialized vocabularies for areas such as medicine, education and the law are covered. Through this course, students will be immersed in an environment simulated to match that of the sign community. All sessions will be conducted in sign language with very minimal use of voice.

## LING3820: PRACTICE IN TRANSITIONING BETWEEN SIGN AND VOICE

This laboratory course provides students with the opportunity to significantly improve their expressive and receptive skills and to acquire skills for transitioning between source and target languages. This course lays a foundation needed in the capstone interpreting practicum. Using visual recordings of signed and spoken communicative events as well as audio recordings of spoken communicative events, students will build their fluency in sign language and learn to identify semantic equivalence between signed and spoken languages. Additionally, students will learn to sign simultaneously and consecutively when a spoken language is the source language and conversely, to voice simultaneously and consecutively when a sign language is the source language. Given that UWI is a Caribbean institution, languages used in CARICOM territories will be employed as the source and target languages in course material.

## LING3909:   THE PROFESSION OF INTERPRETING

This course examines the field of interpreting and the role of an interpreter. It considers how to define the communication process, and how to consider client(s) and do situational assessments. The interpreter role and ethics, the process of interpreting, settings and assignments are also examined.

## LING3910:   THE PRACTICE OF SIGN LANGUAGE

The goal of this course is to produce persons who can perform professionally as Sign Language interpreters. Such persons have to be able to work from a source language to a target language. This means that visual memory, the ability to produce equivalent message content, knowledge of vocabulary and register, and ability to make cultural adaptations are essential. A practicum component involving supervised interpreting experience in different contexts (legal, educational, medical) ensures that students meet these criteria.

## LING3912:   INTERPRETING IN LEGAL SETTINGS (NOT CURRENTLY OFFERED)

Although students have been exposed to interpreting in a variety of settings, they need to develop specialised skills for interpreting in legal settings. Students need to be sensitised to issues specific to working in legal fields. This course will prepare students to work in all stages of the judiciary process - from law enforcement officials to court officials.

## PHILOSOPHY COURSES

<!-- image -->

## PHIL1001:   INTRODUCTION TO LOGIC

This  course  provides  an  introduction  to  essential  principles  of  reasoning  and  critical thinking. It is designed to enhance students' ability to evaluate various forms of reasoning and to examine critically beliefs, conventions and theories, and to develop sound arguments -  good arguments, fair argumentation, and validity. Topics include fundamentals of logic

and analysis, the concept of 'definition,' conceptual analysis, logical fallacies, deduction and induction, analytic and synthetic propositions, and scientific method and explanation.

## PHIL1002:   ETHICS AND APPLIED ETHICS

This course introduces students to the theories of the nature and justification of ethical concepts  and  decision  procedures.  Issues  include  the  relation  between  motivation  and moral  justification,  the  question  whether  morality  is  objective  or  subjective,  relative  or absolute,  and  whether  moral  knowledge  is  possible.  It  considers  the  relation  between morality  and  phenomena  such  as  legality,  religion,  politics,  and  conscience,  and  also critically outlines some of the major theories of moral goodness and right action and their relationship with duty. Issues in applied ethics are explored to introduce students to burning contemporary moral issues.

## PHIL1003:   INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY

This course introduces students with no prior knowledge of philosophy to the perennial issues in philosophy which arise out of the search for truth and meaning in life: good and evil, appearance  and  reality,  the  rational  grounds  for  belief  in  God,  scepticism  and knowledge, social justice. We attempt to examine also basic issues of human existence such as conceptions of human nature, meaning of life, freedom, death and afterlife. The course  emphasizes  critical  thinking  and  the  value  of  understanding  through  the  use  of reasoning and reasoned argumentation.

## PHIL1004:   HISTORY OF ANCIENT PHILOSOPHY

This  course  examines  the  historical  development  of  critical,  sustained  and  reflective thinking of humans in ancient and pre-Christian societies (African, Asian, Eastern, American, European  to  the  time  of  Thales)  with  a  view  to  understanding  the  antecedents  of contemporary  philosophy  on  the  one  hand,  and  the  variations  of  themes  and  factors responsible for such variations in various societies and cultures. For the Caribbean, located in the gateway between the Americas, the investigation of the intellectual foundations of the ancestors of the peoples of the region is urgent and pressing. This course provides the opportunity for this investigation.

## PHIL1006:   THE MEANING OF LIFE AND EXISTENCE

The course is a critical reflection on issues that relate to the question of life and human existence across diverse cultural settings. It explores the concept of life, its purpose, and the conditions for its fulfillment. It also examines the notion of the self, and its relation to the notion of the other within a social and political setting, and the notion of death and the question of life after death.

<!-- image -->

## PHIL2001:   PARADOX ANALYSIS

This is entirely a problem oriented course. We will consider a series of paradoxes, some of which are interrelated, some of which originate in the last couple of decades and some of which are of longer history - dating back to the Pre-Socratics. This approach will not only

allow us to study a wide range of issues in such areas as philosophy of mind, epistemology and ethics, but more importantly, it will lead to an understanding of different contemporary analytic techniques for tackling philosophical problems which challenge our attempts to understand the world.

## PHIL2002:   THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE

This  course  is  problem  oriented,  and  critically  explores  contemporary  answers  to  such questions as: What is knowledge? What are the limitations of knowledge? What is belief? The course also examines the status and extent of our knowledge of the world, of ourselves, and  of  others.  Problems  about  the  nature  of  knowledge,  the  justification  of  claims  of knowledge, the relationship of knowledge to belief and truth, perception, and the viability of scepticism will be discussed.

## PHIL2003:   PHILOSOPHY OF MIND

This course offers an examination of major philosophic theories of the human mind. The traditional dualistic theory that the mind and body are distinctly different will be contrasted with contemporary logical behaviourism and with the modern materialist's theory that the mental can be explained in terms of brain states and brain functions. The course considers the relation between thoughts and sensations and neurological processes, between mental states and brain states. It also considers the existence of animal intelligence and of artificial intelligence.

## PHIL2004:   PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE

This  course  considers  philosophical  questions  pertaining  to  the  nature,  extent  and significance  of  scientific  knowledge.  Problems  will  be  discussed  about  the  nature  of scientific theories and models, about scientific explanation and prediction, about scientific growth,  and  the  relationship  between  science,  religion  and  morality.  It  will  address  the nature  of  truth  in  science  and  justification  in  science  will  be  discussed,  and  consider whether science is a product of interest or is universal.

## PHIL2005:   PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE

This course provides the forum for the exploration of the issues which connect language, logic, communication, intention, representation, predication and understanding. It explores the intersection that these create in our determination of meaning and truth. Topics include the  relation  between  thought  and  language,  between  language  and  the  world,  between linguistic meaning and other kinds of meaning.

## PHIL2006:   METAPHYSICS

This course examines critically the definition, nature and subject matter of metaphysics and truth  in  metaphysics.  It  surveys  the  principal  types  of  theories  of  reality  that  have  been produced in western philosophy, e.g., materialism, idealism, dualism, monism, atomism, and  investigates  major  problems  and  concepts  in  metaphysics,  such  as  time,  space, substance, essence, free will  and  determinism,  causality,  the  nature  of  the  self  and  the problem of universals.

## PHIL2025:    INTRODUCTION TO CARIBBEAN PHILOSOPHY

The  course  deals  with  the  place  of  philosophy  in  the  attempts  of  Caribbean  people  to understand,  represent,  interpret  and  shape  reality  with  their  innate  human  capacity  to reason.    The  course  pursues  the  historically  based  philosophical  explorations  of,  and reflections on, Caribbean conceptions of being, knowledge, ethics, aesthetics, and sexuality, space, existence, etc. The course addresses the question of the existence (historio-genesis) of Caribbean philosophy as thematized by Paget Henry, and the influences on it of local and external existential challenges as well as of Western, Oriental and African philosophies.

## PHIL2028:   SPORTS ETHICS

This course examines the conceptual framework for ethical decision-making, using sports and  moral  conflicts  presented  in  sports  as  prism  through  which  to  examine  normative perspectives.  Key  ethical  theories  will  be  discussed,  including  hedonism,  egoism,  virtue ethics, deontology, utilitarianism, and social contract ethics. Moral ideas and concepts such as character, compassion, weakness of the will, self-sacrifice, self-love, self-interest, duty, obligation,  rights,  fairness,  responsibility,  autonomy  and  agency  will  be  explored.  Also considered are issues such as the ethics of competition; the business of sports; sports and the  good  life,  sportsmanship;  rights  of  athletes;  fair  play;  cheating  and  the  use  of performance enhancing drugs; violence in sports; sports as entertainment, exercise, fun, recreation.

## PHIL2501:    INTRODUCTION TO INDIAN PHILOSOPHY

This course deals with Indian Philosophy in its three major phases, the Vedic, Heterodox, and  Orthodox  Periods.  It  considers  the  origins  of  philosophy  in  the  Indian  context,  its peculiarities  in  that  cultural  context,  and  the  impact  it  has  had  throughout  the  world. Included in its coverage are great religio-philosophical traditions of the Heterodox Period such  as  Jainism  and  Buddhism,  and,  in  the  Orthodox  Period,  the  six-fold  method  of metaphysical  analysis  of  epistemology  [doctrine  of  Knowledge],  ontology  [doctrine  of Reality],  theology  [doctrine  of  God],  cosmology  [doctrine  of  the  Universe],  psychology [doctrine of the Soul] and soteriology [doctrine of Salvation].

## PHIL2502    MAJOR THEMES IN INDIAN PHILOSOPHY

This  course  provides  a  context  in  which  to  reflect  on  the  challenges  of  interpreting  the textual traditions that constitute the inspiration for many Indian philosophers, and raises the  question  of  whether  and  how  we  can  describe  general  characteristics  of  'Indian philosophy.'  The course considers central questions in classical Indian philosophy such as: What are valid sources of  knowledge? What are valid forms of reasoning?  Does God exist?  What is the nature of the self?

It also reflects on the application of the ethical teachings of Mahāyāna Buddhism, Jainism, and Vedānta to personal, social, political, and ecological concerns.

## PHIL2601:   AFRICAN PHILOSOPHY I

This course explores in-depth the African foundation of Greek philosophy. It explores the nature of philosophical thought in pre-classical and classical worlds as found in Asia Minor and Africa. It discusses issues in such areas of philosophy as epistemology, metaphysics, axiology,  logic,  political  philosophy  and  philosophies  of  religion  from  traditional  and

contemporary African philosophical perspectives. Critical attention will be paid to issues of analysis in philosophy and other forms of philosophical methods.

## PHIL2602:   AFRICAN PHILOSOPHY II

This course explores the philosophical and meta-philosophical issues that have pervaded contemporary  African  philosophical  terrain.  These  include  the  ontological  question  in African philosophy and tradition of thinking, peculiarities of philosophy in "oral" societies, the relation between myth, legend, history and religion in philosophy, the natural order of things, phases of discourse, Bantu philosophy and the Intellectualist Thesis.

## PHIL2701:   PHILOSOPHY IN LITERATURE

Works  of  literature  are  sometimes  representations  of  philosophical  problems  as  lived experiences and as such provide opportunities for discussion of philosophy and life. This course is an examination of a number of central philosophical issues as they are reflected in literary works. Among the issues examined are the question of God and the problem of evil, determinism, free will and fatalism, freedom and man's search for identity, the meaning of life and the obligation to obey the law.

## PHIL2702:   INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY OF ART

Civilizations document their existence in three broad ways: their deeds, their works and their art. This course is devoted to an examination of the philosophical issues in art. It considers the question what is art, what is its value, what role does it play in society, and whether aesthetic experience is different from other kinds of experience. It also asks whether art should be judged on moral grounds, and whether art is universally intelligible. It extends these  questions  also  to  modern  manifestations  such  as  fashion  shows,  pageants,  and designs.

## PHIL2902:   MODERN PHILOSOPHY

This course studies what has become known as the school of rationalism, in which three philosophers stand out: Descartes, Spinoza and Leibniz. The course then proceeds to study the school of empiricism, where the works of three figures loom large: Locke, Berkeley and Hume.

Finally, Kant's philosophy is considered as a reaction to both rationalism and empiricism. The course covers a selection of topics drawn from the works of these philosophers with an emphasis on their metaphysical and epistemological aspects.

## PHIL3006:   AMERICAN PHILOSOPHY

The twentieth century saw the spread of American influence in the world. This course is aimed at developing students' understanding of the intellectual and cultural foundations of American society. It asks whether there is a distinct American philosophical tradition, and will be devoted to reflections on issues pertaining to the origins of American philosophy within  the  context  of  Puritanism;  American  intellectual  attempts  to  deal  with  revolution,

slavery and racism; and notions of globalization, democracy and regime change, and the War on Terror.

## PHIL3012:   PHILOSOPHY OF LAW

This  course  provides  a  systematic  consideration  of  the  fundamental  issues  in  the conception and practice of law, including the origin of law, issues pertaining to sovereignty and subject, legitimacy and autonomy, ethics and justice, democracy and the law, gender and the law, discrimination and reverse discrimination, war and laws, and sanctity of life and law - addressing suicide, capital punishment, cloning, organ transplantation, etc. It provides a forum for the discussion of such perennial themes in legal theory as the nature and function of law, its relation to morality, and its connection with social policy. We look at philosophical issues in crime, civil rights, punishment, and the legislation of morality.

## PHIL3018:   PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION

The basic question which this course tries to raise is whether human beings have the ability to explore, understand and communicate knowledge of an experience that is supernatural. The course will critically examine classical modern and contemporary views about religious beliefs, claims and experiences. Various claims have often been made in religion - that God exists, that human beings have souls and that such souls are immortal, that miracles exist, that prayers are efficacious, etc. This course asks whether such claims can be rationally defended, given the fact that they pertain to matters which go beyond physical experience.

## PHIL3025:   THEMES AND ISSUES IN CARIBBEAN PHILOSOPHY

This course will deal with Caribbean attempts to understand, represent and interpret reality in  all  spheres  of  life,  and  engage  in  critical  reflection  on  the  various  beliefs and  cultural practices of the Caribbean, such as Caribbean conceptions of being, knowledge, ethics, aesthetics,  and  sexuality.  The  course  will  address  the  question  of  the  existence  of  a Caribbean  philosophy,  and  the  influences  on  it  of  Western  and  African  philosophies. Attention  will  focus  on  such  social  and  political  traditions  and  issues  as  Garveyism, Rastafari, Carnival, religious diversities, sports, and sexuality.  The course will also explore Marxist perspectives on Caribbean philosophy.

## PHIL3026:   PHILOSOPHY OF ISLAMIC LAW

The contemporary world finds ever increasing commerce between Western Societies, their appendages and the Islamic World.  An understanding of the principles by which the Islamic world operates is important, therefore, from the point of view of comparative philosophy, comparative law, international relations and international trade, cooperation and business. This requires exposure to the Qur'an and the Hadith which are foundations on which Islamic Jurisprudence  is  based.    Students  are  encouraged  to  familiarize  themselves  with  and undertake an analysis of the origin, sources, and schools of Muslim Law and to gain an understanding of the important difference between Sunnis and Shi'ites schools of law.

## PHIL3099:   RESEARCH IN PHILOSOPHY

This year-long course begins with a consideration of different methods of philosophical research. It provides an avenue for critical readings in classical and non-classical works in philosophy, with the objective of developing an awareness of how different philosophers

have dealt with issues in the past and in our contemporary time. The course will culminate in the selection and development of research topics and the production of a research essay.

## PHIL311O: ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS

This  course  introduces  students  to  theoretical  and  practical  concerns  in  environmental ethics. It considers theoretical issues such as the idea of moral status, animal rights, justice, relationships,  exploitation,  and  compensation.  It  connects  these  themes  to  practical environmental  concerns,  including  the  issue  of  biodiversity  loss/species  extinction, pollution,  deforestation,  global  warming  and  environmental  sustainability.    Questions regarding the moral status of animals, future generations, and the environment as a whole are explored.  Also considered are the moral aspects of food production, population policy, and  resource  use.    These  and  other  issues  lead  into  fundamental  questions  of  moral philosophy: What are we morally responsible for? What does it mean to say something is intrinsically  valuable?  Do  animals  have  rights?  Students  will  not  only  learn  about  these themes and practical concerns; they will also be able to weigh the contending issues more rigorously and offer informed answers to fundamental questions of moral philosophy.

## PHIL312O: BIOMEDICALAL ETHICS

Rapid technological, scientific, and social developments have raised ethical concerns about the extent to which research and development in the biomedical field should be conducted. This course engages in a critical examination of ethical problems arising from medicine, healthcare,  and  the  biological  sciences.  It  discusses,  among  others,  ethical  questions concerning organ donation, human and animal testing, medical paternalism, human cloning, gene editing, eugenics, refusal of medical treatment, and human biological enhancement technology. It highlights how philosophical reasoning and philosophical methods can be applied to a variety of issues that we encounter in our everyday lives. Therefore, the course allows  students  to  reflect  on  their  views  of  the  value  of  life  and  enables  them  to  offer informed solutions in public and private practice when thinking about biomedical ethical policies.

## PHIL3510:   PHILOSOPHY OF SEX AND LOVE

This course investigates approaches to love, friendship, marriage, and eroticism  in both classical and contemporary philosophy. It involves an investigation of the nature of sex and the nature of love and of the conceptual relationship between sexuality and love. It also explores the concepts of gender, gender roles and gender equality, and investigates social, ethical and  legal controversies regarding sexual behaviour, marriage, and  privacy. Metaphysical (eg. what is sex?), epistemological (can a member of one sex really know what it is for someone of the opposite sex to experience sexual intercourse?) and ethical queries (is pre-marital sex moral or immoral?) are tackled in this course.

## PHIL3601:   RECENT PHILOSOPHY I

This course introduces students to the philosophical theories, themes and perspectives of the twentieth century. These include existentialism, phenomenology, Marxism, utilitarianism,  analytic  philosophy,  pragmatism,  nihilism,  pacifism,  intuitionism,  linguistic philosophy,  positivism  and  phenomenalism.  The  course  will  attempt  to  underscore  the multifaceted nature of the philosophical perspectives of the age.

## PHIL3602:   RECENT PHILOSOPHY II

This course introduces students to the major issues which have arisen within contemporary philosophical debate toward the closing decades of the twentieth century. The course will present  a  survey  of  the  major  debates  and  attendant  movements  such  as  rationality, objectivity, universalism, ecosophy, racism, racialism, multiculturalism, liberalism, ethnicity, ethnocentrism,  feminism,  gender  philosophy,  and  patriarchalism.  The  contributions  of contemporary philosophical traditions of non-Western cultures to the formulation of issues and debates in recent philosophy will be seriously discussed.

## PHIL3802:   19th CENTURY CONTINENTAL PHILOSOPHY

Continental Philosophy is an umbrella term that conventionally refers to the philosophical work  coming  out  of  France,  Germany,  and  elsewhere  in  continental  Europe  since  the beginning of the nineteenth century. This course concentrates on the nineteenth century period  of  Continental  Philosophy  where  three  post-Kantian  philosophers  along  with  the originators  of  phenomenology  occupy  a  central  place:  Hegel,  Schopenhauer,  Nietzsche, Brentano and Husserl. The course is designed to initiate students into the intricacies of their thoughts and their impact on the subsequent development of Continental Philosophy.

## PHIL3803:   20th CENTURY CONTINENTAL PHILOSOPHY

This course is intended to cover some of the major figures of twentieth century Continental Philosophy  and  their  relevance  to  issues  such  as  post-modernism  and  feminism.  They include philosophers like Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, Sartre, Foucault, Derrida and Rorty.

This one-semester course will allow students to explore a variety of materials and develop their  skills  in  writing  expository  discourse  appropriate  to  their  disciplines  -  by  using  a process approach to reading and writing. Students will focus on issues of question design, interpretation,  evidence,  methodology,  analysis,  objectivity,  and  clarity  in  writing  in  the Humanities and Education. Education students, in particular,  will  critically  evaluate their teaching philosophy and their professional practice, and utilize different genres of writing to document their reflections and conclusions in keeping with the notion that educators should be reflective practitioners.

## FOUN1019:   CRITICAL READING AND WRITING IN THE DISCIPLINES (Yearlong)

This  two-semester  course  will  provide  an  extended  time  period  in  which  students  can engage in the unlearning, learning and relearning necessary to attain a satisfactory level of English language proficiency. It allows for the gradual development of general academic language  proficiency  and  helps  students  to  comprehend  and  critically  engage  with academic texts, and to write effective documented essays and/or reports while developing an understanding of the linguistic context in which they operate in the Caribbean. Students pursuing  the  course  will  be  exposed  to  the  practice  of  writing  in  a  range  of  academic contexts.

## BA FILM STUDIES

Film Studies is a discipline that promotes serious reflection on cinema and its place within history and culture. This interdisciplinary programme allows students to examine the ways in which film advances various artistic, cultural or political values, and shapes society by influencing our imagined place within it.  Critical analysis of the visual image is at the core of this programme which aims to equip students to compete in an increasingly visual world. The programme fosters a deep understanding of cinema as a cultural industry and one of the largest creative industries in the world. Students who complete this programme are expected to become key players in the local and film industry, film culture, supporting and associated industries.

The  BA  in  Film  Studies  combines  courses  drawn  from  a  Film  Studies  concentration,  a Humanities disciplinary concentration, and a Multidisciplinary concentration, offering filmrelated options. In addition, students must satisfy relevant Faculty requirements pertaining to  Foundation  courses  and  a  research-linked  course,  as  well  as  the  Faculty's  foreign language  requirement,  and  the  requirements  regarding  the  distribution  of  credits  over programme levels. This flexible, interdisciplinary Major allows students to select courses that reflect their professional interests; it empowers them to build a programme tailored to their needs and career paths.

The courses in Film Studies fall into three (3) clusters:

-  Film Studies concentration
-  Humanities concentration
-  Multidisciplinary concentration

## 1. FILM STUDIES CONCENTRATION:

'Core' film courses fall within this concentration. In these courses students learn the skills and concepts of the discipline and are exposed to the history of film, connecting the rise of cinema in the Caribbean to historical film movements from around the world. Students  will  discover  that  film  consists  of  fundamental  building  blocks,  including narrative, image, soundtrack, mise-en-scène and editing.

## 2. HUMANITIES CONCENTRATION:

Students will select an academic discipline in the Humanities to explore alongside Film Studies.  This  additional  disciplinary  focus  helps  provide  an  understanding  of  the broader  context  in  which  film  operates,  whether  historical,  social,  philosophical,  or cultural.  The  courses  in  this  cluster  encourage  students  to  explore  synergies  with phenomena  in  literature,  communication,  translation,  and/or  documentation. The options available in this concentration are drawn from the Humanities concentrations in the BA Liberal Studies programme

## 3. MULTIDISCIPLINARY CONCENTRATION

This concentration provides students with the opportunity to specialize in a field of their  choice to better tailor their degree towards their chosen career path. Students must choose ONE from the following list of concentrations.

## BA FILM STUDIES: SCREENWRITING

This new programme provides a unique option for students interested in Film Studies to explore the mechanics, requirements and demands of screenwriting with ample opportunity to apply learned theory to practice. Students will study film aesthetics and theory as well as acquire basic skills in the elements of filmmaking.

The  BA  in  Film  Studies  (Screenwriting)  combines  courses  drawn  from  a  Film  Studies concentration, a Humanities disciplinary concentration, and a Screenwriting Multidisciplinary concentration. In addition, students must  satisfy relevant Faculty requirements pertaining to Foundation courses and a research-linked course, as well as the Faculty's foreign language requirement, and the requirements regarding the distribution of credits  over  programme  levels.  This  flexible,  interdisciplinary  Major  allows  students  to select  courses  that  reflect  their  professional  interests;  it  empowers  students  to  build  a programme tailored to their needs and career paths.

The BA Film Studies (Screenwriting) consists of three concentrations:

- 1) A Film Studies concentration (24 credits)
- 2) A Humanities Liberal Studies concentration (24 credits)
- 3) A Screenwriting Multidisciplinary concentration (24 credits)

FILM STUDIES CONCENTRATION: These 'core' film courses allow students to learn the skills and  concepts  of  the  discipline.  Students  will  discover  that  film  consists  of fundamental  building  blocks,  including  narrative,  image,  soundtrack,  mise-en-scène  and editing. They will also learn about the history of film, connecting the rise of cinema in the Caribbean to historical film movements from around the world.

## HUMANITIES CONCENTRATION:

Students will select an academic discipline in the Humanities to explore alongside Film Studies. This additional disciplinary focus helps provide an understanding of the broader context  in  which  film  operates,  whether  historical,  social,  philosophical,  or  cultural.  The courses  in  this  cluster  encourage  students  to  explore  synergies  with  phenomena  in literature, communication, translation, and/or documentation. The options available in this concentration are drawn from the Humanities concentrations in the BA Liberal Studies programme. Students must choose ONE concentration from the options listed. (See the listing of  options in the Humanities Concentration on page xxx under  the BA Film Studies.)

## SCREENWRITING CONCENTRATION

The  Screenwriting  concentration  lends  an  added  dimension  to  the  study  of  the  formal elements  of  film,  which  revolves  around  the  choices  made  by  the  filmmaker.  The Screenwriting Multidisciplinary concentration will allow students to experience first-hand knowledge of how these choices are made. This concentration will impart fundamental skills in elements of filmmaking, specifically, screenwriting.

The structure of the BA Film Studies (Screenwriting) programme is as follows :

| LEVEL I                                                                                  | LEVEL II                                                             | LEVEL III                                                  |

## BA LIBERAL STUDIES

Many students enter the University with multiple interests that are not easily covered by a single or even double major. The Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Studies is a multi-disciplinary degree  programme  that  allows  students  to  design  a  course  of  study  tailored  to  their individual  interests  and  career  goals.  Employers  increasingly  value  candidates  with interdisciplinary degrees, since they come to the workplace with a broad knowledge base as  well  as  strong  analytical  and  communication  skills.  The  Liberal  Studies  programme includes nineteen (19) possible areas of focus (concentrations) from within the Faculty of Humanities and Education and the Faculty of Social Sciences. Students choose three (3) areas of concentration.

The Liberal Studies Degree comprises a minimum of 90 credits distributed as follows:

-  24 credits in each of two (2) concentrations within the Faculty of Humanities and Education, AND either
-  24 credits in one (1) concentration within the Faculty of Social Sciences, OR 24 credits in a third concentration within the Faculty of Humanities and Education;
-  12-15  credits  in  Foundation  courses  (FOUN1016  or  FOUN1019,  FOUN1002, FOUN1201 and FOUN1301);
-  A minimum of three (3) credits in a foreign language course (unless exempted);
-  Up to six (6) credits in electives.'

For each concentration, students are required to complete 6-9 credits in Level I courses and at least six (6) credits in Level III courses. Students are also required to complete one (1) research-linked course at Level III.

## Description of Concentrations :

- 1. Cultural Studies : A concentration in this increasingly influential field of study enables students to examine the ways in which culture permeates human existence. It enables critical analysis of past and contemporary cultures globally and allows students to assess the impact of cultural convergence on our individual cultural identities.
- 2. History : This concentration allows students to explore the past using two approaches to such exploration: history which focuses on written and oral record, and archaeology, which focuses on physical remains. Students in this concentration will gather in-depth knowledge on existence before and after humans as well as of earlier human societies.
- 3. Information Studies : In this concentration, students are equipped with knowledge regarding technology, data science, and communications that allow them to enter into careers in information units such as museums, galleries, archives and

documentation centres. Specialist knowledge in this area allows students to gain employment as information officers, records managers, marketing agents within the book industry, online searchers, web masters, researchers, and information brokers, among others.

- 4. Integrated Marketing Communication : This concentration addresses changes that are taking place in an increasingly converged media and communication environment, where agencies and institutions - corporate, state and para-statal - offer a range of services rather than being engaged as discrete, stand-alone operations. The intention is to equip students to be competent on converged communication platforms and bring convergence of thoughts, processes, and techniques in communication.
- 5. Linguistics :  There are a number of concentrations available in the discipline of Linguistics. These are:
-  General Linguistics
-  Language and Communication
-  Language and Society
-  The Structure of Language.

Each  concentration  focuses  on  a  different  area  of  Linguistics  ranging  from  the  core subjects of the field to the social and communicative value of language and the Sociology of Language.

- 6. Literatures in English :  With courses that focus on areas that include Literatures in English, Film Studies, Creative Writing and Literature, this concentration provides a creative and academically sound platform of teaching and research designed to produce students who are incisive and imaginative critical thinkers with excellent oral and written communication skills.
- 7. Modern Languages : The concentrations available in Modern Languages are:
-  French
-  Japanese
-  Chinese (Mandarin)
-  Spanish

These  concentrations  are  intended  to  produce  multilingual  graduates  who  can  work  in international organisations and global contexts with the advantage of knowledge of one or more language, as well as their contexts of use and communicative value.

- 8. Philosophy : A concentration in Philosophy allows for sustained reflection on the ideas and issues that move individuals and groups of individuals in all human societies. Courses in the Philosophy concentration address issues pertaining to ethics, human existence and experience, the value of cultural knowledge, and the meaning of notions that we take for granted. Critical reflection is at the core of this specialisation.

## CONCENTRATIONS IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES:

- 1. International Relations :  International Relations helps us to better understand the international system in which we live. Students taking this concentration learn about the inter-connected relationships between and among countries, governments, local and international organizations, and businesses, as well as groups and people.
- 2. Political Science : This concentration provides students with in-depth, critical study and analysis of political theories, concepts, and practices. It aims to equip students with the scientific knowledge and skills to better understand and explain leading principles in the world of politics such as power, government, and governance.
- 3. Psychology : A concentration in Psychology will allow students to improve their understanding of the biological, cognitive, emotional, and social influences on the human experience. It also aims to improve their critical thinking and problem-solving skills, while engendering an appreciation of the theoretical and practical implications of psychology.
- 4. Sociology : This concentration seeks to equip students to understand the social interaction between individuals and groups in society. By engaging with various research and theories in the field, students gain an appreciation of the social causes and consequences of human behaviour in society.
- 5. Tourism Managem ent:  A concentration in Tourism Management is designed to educate students on the theories, principles and practices of the tourism industry.

## BA LITERATURES IN ENGLISH

The major in Literatures in English is the Department's longest-running degree programme and has evolved over time from teaching literary studies narrowly defined, to a programme located at the intersection of literary and cultural studies.

The major in Literatures in English requires a minimum of at least 12 courses or 36 credits in LITS-CODED COURSES.

Students who wish to read Level II or Level III courses in Literature, should have passed the Level I course in the particular genre. For example, LITS1001 is required for all Level II and III courses in Poetry, LITS1002 is required for all Level II and III courses in Prose Fiction, and LITS1003 is required for all Level II and III courses in Drama. Note that some courses may have more than one Level I course as pre-requisites.

All students declaring a Major in Literatures in English must by the end of their final year have passed the following Level II or Level III courses, with no course counting more than once:

- i. A Course in West Indian Literature
- ii. A Poetry Course
- iii. A Shakespeare Course
- iv. A Modern Prose Fiction Course
- v. A Course in Critical Approaches or Literary Theory (such as a 'Key Issues' course).

## Course Descriptions

<!-- image -->

## HUMN1101:  INTRODUCTION TO COMPARATIVE CARIBBEAN LITERATURE I:  AFRO-CARIBBEAN POETRY

A survey of negritude and other 'black conscious' poetry movements in the English, French and Spanish-speaking Caribbean (in English translation). Questions examined will include: the  writer's  perception  of  and  relationship  to  Africa;  the  problems  defining  a  'black aesthetic'; the relationship between writing and politics. The poets whose works are studied include Aimé Césaire, Léon Damas, Nicolás Guillen, Claude McKay, Léopold Senghor and Kamau Brathwaite.

## HUMN1102: INTRODUCTION TO COMPARATIVE CARIBBEAN LITERATURE II: WOMEN'S WRITING

In this course, the major concerns of women writers in the region, will be examined through a survey of writing from the English, French and Spanish-speaking Caribbean (in translation if the original text is not in English). The current emphasis is on prose fiction - novel and short story. In addition to extracts from the prescribed anthology, two novels will be studied in detail.

## LITS1001:  INTRODUCTION TO POETRY

An introduction to methods and techniques of critical appreciation of poetry.  The lectures will be complemented by assignments in critical analysis of a variety of poems from the prescribed text and elsewhere.

## LITS1002:   INTRODUCTION TO PROSE FICTION

Focusing on selected novels arising out of varying cultural contexts, the course provides an introduction to key issues in the study of prose fiction.  John Peck's How to Study a Novel is  a  highly  recommended  text.  In  his  'Preface,'  Peck  notes  that  'literary  criticism  is  an activity, like any other, with its own rules and well-established modes of conduct.  But these rules are seldom, if ever explained to the newcomer.  He or she is likely to be thrown in at the deep end, and, in a confused sort of way, from the observation of others, expected to establish  what  the  rules  are.'    The  purpose  of  this  course  is  to  guide  students  into  an understanding of what literary criticism is and how to apply it in the study of representative shorter and longer fictions.

## LITS1003:   INTRODUCTION TO DRAMA

An  exciting  and  suspenseful  performance  on  stage  is  the  result  of  playwrights'  careful design of several fundamental elements of drama. These include dialogue, plot, characters and  stage  props,  for  example.  The  course  examines  the  factors  which  determine  the selection and arrangement of dramatic elements across socio-historical, geographical and national contexts to create meaning for audiences.

## LITS1004:   INTRODUCTION TO ORATURE

The course will introduce students to some of the genres of oral literature. It will examine

structures of orality; speech acts and events; performances strategies and paralinguistic features; textual originality and variation; relationship between oral and scribal literature.

## LITS1006:   INTRODUCTION TO FILM

If you have a passion for movies, this class will help you deepen your enjoyment and expand your  critical  thinking  about  film.  In  this  course  you  will  learn  the  core  concepts  of  film analysis and you will be exposed to a wide range of films. Lecture and readings will focus on  the  fundamentals  of  film  technique  (camera  techniques,  editing,  sound,  etc.)  and principles of narrative structure. Along with questions of film technique and style, assigned films will illuminate the range of social, cultural, political and historical topics that cinema opens up for our discussion and debate. Students will be exposed to essential masterpieces of cinema history, popular contemporary films and local Caribbean films. Success in the course requires attention to both the films and the assigned readings. Assignments will ask students to watch, analyze, and write about film in original and thoughtful ways.

## LITS1007:   READING AND WRITING ABOUT LITERATURE

This course equips students with analytical, critical and compositional skills necessary for successful  undergraduate  study.  Guidance  and  practice  are  provided  in  the  following: reading  the  literary  genres  of  poetry,  prose  fiction,  graphic  novel,  and  drama;  producing insightful close readings; writing cogent and compelling essays using core principles of argumentation  and  paragraph  organization;  evaluating,  engaging  with  and  citing  critical material; and making effective use of the editing process. Sequenced writing tasks give students ample opportunity to write and revise work.

## LITS1009:   INTRODUCTION TO CREATIVE WRITING

This  course  provides  fundamental  support  to  beginning  writers  and  also  to  more experienced creative writers who want to develop new work and extend scope and range of skills.  This course familiarizes students with the techniques of effective, creative writing across  a  variety  of  genres:  fiction,  drama,  and  poetry.  Through  reading  and  writing exercises, students learn how to better produce effective language (like significant detail; lyrical language and memorable image; inventive metaphor and simile; form; and authentic voice;),  short  fiction  (like  building  dialogue  and  characterization),  micro  short  story  (like honing perspective and point of view), drama (like elements of film and practices of the stage), and poetry (like sounds, rhythms, and form).

## LITS1501:    INTRODUCTION TO CHAUCER

The course requires students to read Chaucer in the original. The focus of the study will be Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, with a core consisting of the general prologue and FOUR tales.

## PUBL1001:   THE WORLD OF PUBLISHING

The course will begin with a brief history of the book that will situate the art and business of book publishing within a broad socio-political context. It will identify major innovations and advances in publishing over the last 500 years, with emphasis on the introduction of new technologies in the late 20 th   and  21 st   centuries.  Students  will  be  introduced  to  the requirements  and  demands  of  the  main  categories  of  modern  book  publishing,  namely trade/commercial, scholarly and educational publishing, with attention paid to the stages and  phases  of  production  involved  in  each  of  these  categories.  The  course  will  also

introduce students to the language and terminology of the publishing world as well as the roles of various players involved in the enterprise of publishing.

## HUMN2201 LITERATURE AND IDEAS IN THE CARIBBEAN

This  course  focuses  on  selected  issues  in  writing  across  the  Caribbean,  including  the following  topics  (with  emphases  which  may  vary  from  time  to  time):    the  treatment  of history,  nationalism,  gender  concerns,  neo-colonialism,  anti-imperialism  and  Marxism, religion, choice  of  language,  narrative  technique,  orature,  magic  realism,  Caribbean literature as counter-discourse.

## LITS2003:   POETRY AND NARRATIVE

This course will explore the forms, uses and concerns of a range of narrative poetry in English. It will draw on a selection of critical theory about the significance of the narrative impulse in poetry, and about its place in the spectrum of poetic forms, and will attempt to suggest how narrative forms and strategies have evolved.

## LITS2004:   LOVE, DEATH AND POETRY

Emphasizing diversity of attitude and technique, the course will examine a range of poems dealing with love and death, which are perennial themes.

## LITS2006:   NOLLYWOOD: GENRES OF AFRICAN FILM

This course offers the chance to explore Nollywood through its genres, and to interrogate genre from the perspective of an African film culture. Genres are essentially a way to group films according to shared formal conventions. Film genres emerge and change with the growth  of  cinema,  and  come  to  be  recognizable  to  audiences  as  distinct  'types,' 'categories,' or 'movements' within film. Students will view comedies, romantic comedies, crime  films,  melodramas,  and  films  noirs  made  by  Nollywood  filmmakers  for  popular audiences across Africa and the African diaspora, including the Caribbean. This course will examine this range of genres to better understand how they are inflected by the cinema in which they develop and evolve, and how they reflect the concerns, anxieties, or desires of the societies in which they circulate.

## LITS2103:   MODERN PROSE FICTION

The course will examine approaches to prose fiction in the 20 th  Century, from the traditional to the experimental. It will explore some of the techniques and concerns of modern fiction, through detailed study of four or five texts.

## LITS2107:   AFRICAN/DIASPORA WOMEN'S NARRATIVE

The course defines indigenous African feminist perspectives from which to compare the diasporic African-American and Caribbean texts. The authors' use of narrative conventions and  modes  such  as  autobiography,  the  bildungsroman,  the  romance,  the  quest/journey motif, dreams, visions and awakenings suggests a tradition of female discourses that cross lines of race,  class,  ethnicity  and  gender.  These  female-authored  African/Diasporic

narratives employ 'mainstream' canonical literary techniques, while simultaneously sharing discursive strategies with other feminist  texts that contest  the hegemony  of  the phallocentric  literary  canon.  Techniques  of  oracy,  for  example,  constitute  an  alternate, privileged discourse for those African/Diasporic women writers.

## LITS2108:   MODERN AMERICAN LITERARY PROSE

This course looks critically at the terms 'American' and 'Modern' by using writers from different ethnic/cultural backgrounds, which may include Native-American, Euro-American, African-American, Caribbean-American, and Asian-American. Five texts will be studied in detail, in relation to their particular sources.

## LITS2111:     NARRATIVES OF MIGRATION

This course focuses on a selection of narratives tracing migration from former colonies to their  metropolitan  capitals  as  well  as  from  diverse  territories  to  North  American  cities. Among the thematic concerns reflected in the texts are: the nature of diaspora, the myth of the Mother Country, the American dream, displacement, relocation, belonging, transnationalism, multiculturalism, hybridity, national and regional identities, and bilingualism. The prescribed texts, which include films as well as novels, are the work of writers/directors originating from the Caribbean (Anglophone, Francophone and Hispanic), from Africa and from Asia.

## LITS2113:   WRITING AFRICA FROM THE DIASPORA

This course seeks to examine the literary representations of Africa, with specific reference to selected texts by writers from the African Diaspora (USA and the Caribbean). Specific attention will be paid to issues/concepts such as slavery, the middle passage, diaspora, pan-Africanism, identity, gender and memory.

## LITS2120:    THE GRAPHIC NOVEL

Combining text and images, graphic novels are among the most innovative and popular forms of storytelling. This course explores the history and evolution of the graphic novel and equips students to respond critically and imaginatively to the way graphic novels use narrative and visual representation to convey meaning. In reading graphic novels diverse in subject  matter,  place  of  origin,  cultural  perspective  and  medium  (print  and  web-based), students will learn and apply strategies for textual and visual analysis and explore the effect of  digital  technologies  on  the  formal  features,  distribution  and  consumption  of  graphic narratives.

## LITS2201:   DRAMA I

The course surveys selected plays from the Ancient Greek period to the 18 th  Century to identify how specific dramatic modes are deployed to represent Man's relationship with God(s). The course considers how important philosophical ideas across the period inform the drama of the time in expressing the challenges and consequence of man's action in the world.

## LITS2202:   DRAMA II

The role and function of important social institutions like the family, marriage and church are called into question by the rise of scientific enquiry into the mind and desires of man. The selected plays on this course examine the works of August Strindberg, Henrik Ibsen and  other  modern  playwrights  as  they  demonstrate  the  unexpected,  if  not,  shocking outcomes that the conflict about life choices can produce.

## LITS2207:   INTRODUCTION TO SHAKESPEARE

After 400 years, the poetry and drama of William Shakespeare has taken on new meaning. His work is not just for academic study, but provides important influence for creatives in the worlds of theatre, film, poetry, performance studies etc. Through a study of selected works, the course will explore the factors that makes his work relevant today.

## LITS2301:   KEY ISSUES IN LITERARY CRITICISM I: INTERPRETATION

Interpretation  (establishing  the  meaning[s]  of  the  text)  is  an  integral  part  of  literary appreciation. This course examines the issues which arise from the idea and practice of interpreting  literary  texts.  The  aim  is  not  to  teach  us  how  to  interpret,  but  to  make  us understand what it is we do when we interpret, and what considerations ought to be taken into account in trying to deal with the issues. If, in the process our critical and interpretative skills are enhanced, so much the better.

## LITS2304:   KEY ISSUES IN LITERARY CRITICISM II: THE NATURE AND FUNCTION OF LITERATURE

This course is an introduction to some of the most common concepts of literary theory and criticism. Its purpose is twofold: firstly, to introduce students to key critical concepts and issues in selected twentieth-century literary theories, and secondly, to enable students to apply critical theories and concepts in their own reading of literary texts.

## LITS2402:   FOLK TALE &amp; PROVERB

This  course  will  consist  of  the  following:  Types  of  oral  narrative,  analytic  approaches, various  story-telling  traditions  and  structural  characteristics  of  the  proverb,  relationship between proverb and oral narrative.

## LITS2502:   WEST INDIAN LITERATURE II: WOMEN'S FICTION

Focusing  on  writing  by  women  from  the  Creole/Anglophone  Caribbean,  the  course examines recurring thematic preoccupations and stylistic preferences that appear to define a distinctly female sensibility.

## LITS2503:    WEST INDIAN POETRY

An introduction to the range of West Indian poetry in English.

## LITS2504:   INTRODUCTION TO THE WEST INDIAN NOVEL

This  course  offers  an  introduction  to  the  West  Indian  novel,  by  survey  lectures  and  by detailed  study  of  six  novels.    Course  readings  and  lectures  are      organized  around comparative   analysis of issues,   such as the emergence of West Indian fiction in the context of political and cultural nationalism; the West Indianization of the novel form; the relationship between language and literature; the politics of race and gender; the emergence

of West Indian female writers; culture and identity; popular culture, desire, and the erotic; diaspora, imagination and community. Throughout, we will pay close attention to the variety of styles and genres employed in West Indian fiction.

## LITS2505:   WEST INDIAN DRAMA

This course is an introduction to West Indian drama in English, with attention to sources, historical development, major writers and modes, as well as performance practices and the ideas which inform them. The study of the plays will consider the differences between the dramatic text as an object of literary study and the play text or script as a 'blueprint' for performance. The course undertakes a historical survey of the development of theatre in the  West  Indies  with  reference  to  some  of  the  most  prominent  playwrights  to  answer questions like: (a) What makes a play West Indian? (b) How do indigenous, traditional forms influence theatre practice? (c) To what extent and how does the theatre respond to political issues in the nation(s)/region?

## LITS2511:   WEST INDIAN AUTOBIOGRAPHY

To write one's life story is a deliberate act of personal agency. It does, however, also affect the lives of family and friends as well, especially in the small societies of the region. To reveal  personal  and  private  details  of  lives-self,  other,  or  institution-  has  ethical implications in the real world. The course examines the strategies, modes, challenges and concerns that West Indian subjects navigate in narrating their lives. Autobiographical theory is  applied  to  the  reading  of  selected  texts  to  reveal  the  intriguing  nature  of  this  writing project.

## LITS2603:   CREATIVE WRITING: POETRY

This  is  a  workshop  course  in  the  writing  of  poetry.  Students  will  be  required  to  write regularly, and to submit new pieces of their work at least once a fortnight for workshop discussion.

This is a workshop course in the writing of prose fiction.  Students will be required to write regularly,  and  submit  new  pieces  of  their  work  at  least  once  a  fortnight  for  workshop discussion.

## LITS2606:  CREATIVE WRITING: SCREEN &amp; STAGE

This course will introduce students to the fundamentals of screenwriting by way of lectures and a succession of workshops with emphasis on the development of screenplay shorts. Students will be taken through the process of focusing their broad story ideas, into clear dramatic premises, and will be taught the essential elements needed for a well-constructed story.  The course aims at giving students an understanding of the basic structural elements of screenwriting, as well as practical experience in crafting screenplays.  Each student will, therefore, be required to transform his/her story idea into a working treatment (outline) with the view to him/her completing a first draft of his/her original 10-minute screenplay.

## LITS2706:   REGGAE POETRY

Focusing on the critique of reggae lyrics as poetry, the course traces themes and poetic techniques in selected song-texts. In addition, students are required to pay attention to the

Return to Table of Content

socio-historical  context  out  of  which  the  music  emerges  from  its  hybrid  origins  in  both Jamaican folk forms and imported Rhythm and Blues. The course begins with a survey of the development of reggae music, employing selections from Reggae Routes: The Story of Jamaican Music and moves up into the contemporary.  This course will examine in detail various song-texts created by some of reggae music's major song writers/performers: Ernie Smith, Burning Spear, Jimmy Cliff, Peter Tosh, Bob Marley, Steel Pulse, Tanya Stephens, Vybz Kartel, Jah9, Ishawna and Buju Banton, Chronixx, Protoje, Queen Ifrica.

## LITS2806   REGGAE FILMS: SCREENING JAMAICA

Historically, the cinema has made a significant contribution to the development of a global discourse  that  defines  Jamaica  as  exotic  destination,  site  of  fantasy,  adventure  and romance, and more recently as danger zone. Since the 1970s, however, with the emergence of local narrative films , the cinema has also functioned as a vehicle for the expression of an internal rather than external gaze. Popular Jamaican music has occupied a pivotal and complex role in the development of a Jamaican cinema and in the crafting of this internal gaze and perspective. The course will examine up to six films set in Jamaica and/or its diasporic  communities,  some  of  which  use  reggae  and  dancehall  music  as  part  of  a deliberate narrative strategy, with particular emphasis on the representation of place.

## LITS2901:   LATIN AMERICAN CULTURAL STUDIES

The course is an introductory overview of the field of Cultural Studies as it is practiced and theorized in Spanish-speaking regions of the Americas. It will help prepare students for careers in business, diplomacy, education, entertainment, public relations, etc. that require a  knowledge  of  the  Hispanic  world.  NOTE:  Modern  Language  Spanish  students  will  be required  to  undertake  research  in  Spanish,  and  cite  the  Spanish  version  of  texts,  when available.  But  all  novels  will  be  available  in  English  translation;  Spanish  films  will  be  in subtitled versions. Course objectives include: to expose students in the English-speaking Caribbean to some key cultural currents and preoccupations in the Spanish-speaking world that surrounds them; to identify and analyse the tensions within defining an "Indian soul" in Latin  America;  to  recognise  the  pervasive  influence  of  Afro-Hispanic  peoples  in  the Americas; to understand "Nuestra América" as a site of opposition to North America, as well as its inter-relationships with North American cultural, political, and economic currents.

## LITS2905:    FILM HISTORY

This  course  demonstrates that  the  moment  film  emerged  in  1895  it  did  so  as  a  global phenomenon that inspired distinct film practices and film cultures around the world. To manage this complexity, this course will approach history by way of the auteur directors, film movements, and national cinemas that represent key paradigms. It examines dominant traditions,  such  as  Hollywood's  classical  cinema,  alongside  competing  film  movements that  pursued  not  a  cinema  of  commercialism  but  of  political  opposition,  aesthetic innovation,  and  radical  experimentation.  These  forces  have  driven  the  development  of cinema in divergent directions, therefore students will interrogate the politics of film history and the struggle over the pleasures, agency, and power that cinema promises.

## LITS2906:   FILM ADAPTATION

Novels are a major source or raw material for films, and hotly contested debates about whether the film or the novel is better often erupt when individuals have knowledge of both versions. The course will move beyond the rather narrow concern of fidelity, to examine the mobility  of  meaning  in  the  process  of  adaptation;  various  approaches  to  the  study  of adaptation;  the  assumptions  and  biases  that  inform  responses  to  adaptations;  and  the underlying theory that informs the process of adaptation. The course will also take into account other forms of adaptation, such as stage to screen, film to novel, films made for television etc. The course will involve the close study of at least three 'source' texts and their adaptations; students will explore how these narratives change in the transfer from one medium to another, and in the process generate new meaning.

## LITS2907:   WOMEN IN CINEMA

This  course  will  situate cinema  within  various  feminist  theories  of  representation, spectatorship  and  narration.  It  considers  cinema  as  a  powerful  technology  for  the positioning of women both on screen and in society and engages students with feminist film  criticism,  which  entails  the  critical  examination  of  these  various  positionings.  The course considers debates ranging from the objectification of women as figures of 'to-belooked-at-ness,' to the erasure of women by virtue of dominant prejudices about race, class, sexuality and body-image. Students will view films by and about women, especially women of the Caribbean, Africa and the diaspora, to demonstrate that the concerns of women are inevitably  intersected  by  matters  of  race,  class  and  culture.  This  selection  of  films  will permit them to interrogate the seeming gender neutrality of dominant cinema, while also gaining a broader view of the diversity of gender practices in film and the world at large. The goal of the course will be to ask how women are able to gain control over their position in society by both using films to their own ends and creating films in their own ways.

## PUBL2001: PUBLISHING IN THE CARIBBEAN: FROM IDEA TO PRODUCT

Building  on  the  introductory  knowledge  gained  in  the  Level  1  course  (PUBL1001),  this course focuses more specifically on the processes involved in carrying a product from idea to publication within the context of book publishing in the Caribbean. The course develops a more detailed understanding of the varied and multiple tasks, activities and steps involved in book publishing with particular emphasis on identifying and responding to the specific conditions  and  challenges  encountered  in  the  Caribbean.  The  course  begins  with  an overview of publishing in the Caribbean that will consider the performance of traditional and non-tradition publishing and products, as well as the potential for growth and expansion. Students  are  also  oriented  with  regard  to  the  impact  of  publishing  on  the  cultural  and intellectual development of the region. The course will go on to provide students with insight into  the  steps  involved  in  the  publishing  process,  identified  here  as  (i)  Acquisition  (ii) Editorial  &amp;  Production  and  (iii)  Marketing  and  Distribution.  Consideration  is  given  to  the exploration of innovative practices in all phases of the process, including the use of new technologies to increase efficiency, non-traditional approaches to marketing and strategies to develop new content.

## LITS3002:   MYTH, EPIC AND THE HERO

When Kendrick Lamar raps about a hero, we listen: "Who need a hero? (hero)/ You need a hero,  look  in  the  mirror,  there  go  your  hero/Who  on  the  front  lines  at  ground  zero? (hero)."  Marvel's 2018 Black Panther film brought a new Afro focus to a storytelling tradition that endures worldwide. This course will examine the social value of the hero while also questioning  why  society  creates  myths  and  why  epics  continue  to  be  remixed  and retold.  With a focused awareness of the modern-day realities of race, class, and gender, students will explore and analyze some of the oldest storytelling we have -- myth, epic, and the hero stories -- as presented in more contemporary film, novel, poetry, and comic book texts.

## LITS3006:   BORDERLANDS CINEMA

The  course  begins  with  a  brief  overview  of  film  theory  and  information  about  film production. Its focus is primarily thematic, analysing cinematic treatments of relationships across  boundaries  of  nation,  ethnicity,  religion,  species,  etc.  The  course  draws  on interpretive  skills  taught  in  literature  departments,  but  also  social-cultural  analysis  as developed in the social  sciences, and  forms  of  analysis specific  to  cinema. Among the objectives: to introduce students to the concept of film literacy; to compare film language with  related  idioms:  literary  language,  the  languages  of  popular  culture,  politics,  etc.;  to encourage thought and research papers on topics specific to the cinematic challenges of representing relations that transgress the boundaries of "race," nation, region, gender, etc.

## LITS3103:   THE CITY IN FICTION

Using theories about space, architecture and reading practices, this course reads selected texts to explore how the city as place, concept, fantasy and goal are deployed by writers across modes of fiction. While both the short story and novel are primary forms for the

representation of  city  life,  the  course  will  use  other  media  to  discover  new  ideas  about reading practices and city spaces.

## LITS3106:   WORLD CINEMAS

World cinema describes the very nature of film today. In the past, the focus of film studies centered on national cinemas, particularly Hollywood, but the globalization of cinema has blurred old boundaries and inspired more globally minded stories and images. This course will situate cinema within various theories of globalization, post-colonialism, and migration. Students will view Latin American, Caribbean, Indian and African films, including examples of Third Cinema, New Caribbean Cinema, Hong Kong Cinema, Bollywood and Nollywood. This selection will permit them to examine film cultures of the Global South, and thereby develop a broader view of the world and its diversity of films. These films and readings will prompt students to examine the patterns that appear across societies. Students will have ample opportunity to analyze and interrogate the portrait of the world offered up by these films. The goal of the course will be to ask what cinema teaches about the world today.

## LITS3111:   CONTEMPORARY SCIENCE FICTION

Science Fiction is one of the most popular and socially responsible contemporary genres, but has  traditionally been  excluded  from  academic  study,  and  remains  neglected throughout the Commonwealth. This course provides an introduction to the history, critical reception, and contemporary practice of this major form of prose fiction, looking at novels from the UK, US, and Jamaica.

## LITS 3113:   AFRICA IN THE BLACK ATLANTIC IMAGINATION

This course focuses on the invention of Africa, giving particular attention to how members of the African diaspora have imagined Africa and created new understandings of African identity. The dispersal of Africans throughout the Americas and elsewhere occasioned by the  transatlantic  slave  trade  created  hybrid  communities/nations  of  people  of  African descent worldwide, known as the African diaspora. This course will approach questions of racial  and  cultural  identity  through  the  frame  of  the  black  Atlantic  world.  We'll  consider literary representations of Africa, along with political movements and global perspectives linking black writers from the Americas, Europe, and Africa. Drawing on works primarily by African, African American and Caribbean writers, we'll explore the subjectivities, solidarities and cultural production of the black Atlantic world.

## LITS3203:   THE ROMANCE

Beginning with Samuel Richardson's prefiguring narrative. Pamela, the course analyses the evolution of the genre of the Romance. Focusing on tropes of discovery and conquest, we will  consider  ways  in  which  the  project  of  'Romance'  encodes  both  patriarchal  and colonialist  notions  of  the  body  of  the  woman  (and  phallocentricism  among  men).    The course will also explore the degree to which Caribbean authors either replicate, or transform the conventions of the genre to accommodate local cultures/myth.

## LITS3204:   SHAKESPEARE I

This will be a study  of selected  tragedies and  histories, with detailed focus  on Shakespearean dramaturgy, the evolution and innovations of Shakespearean tragedy and

the epic forms of theatre and film. The course will consider the texts and their intersections with modern dramas of 'origins' and 'history' like the Game of Thrones and Harry Potter series.

## LITS3205:   SHAKESPEARE II

This will be a study of selected Shakespearean comedies and Late Plays. The course will theorize how aspects of comedy such as disguise, cross-dressing, sleep and music function in shaping performance and the audience's understanding of power on the Renaissance stage. Theories of laughter, the Uncanny and the body will be applied to the reading of social issues and their implications for modern interpretations of the texts.

## LITS3316:   POSTCOLONIAL LITERATURE I

This course will introduce students to postcolonial literature by focusing on the depiction of the colonial encounter in texts written by authors from formerly colonized regions of the world.

## LITS3317:   POSTCOLONIAL LITERATURE II

This course will explore the literary depiction of nationalism and the nation, in selected texts from Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the South Pacific. The region of focus will vary from year to year.

## LITS3319:   THE SONNET

There are two major components:

- 1. A  historical  survey  of  works  in  the  sonnet  form  from  the  Renaissance  to  the Victorian period, with focus on thematic preoccupations, structural patterns and cultural range. Text of well-known and lesser-known poets of the Beach Period will be examined.
- 2. An exploration of the dynamic 'space' of the sonnet, and the ways in which pre and post 20 th  century writers subvert its structure as they write within, and back from the Empire.

## LITS3402:   CLASSIC AMERICAN PROSE FICTION

This course explores a set of American novels within the context of the literary and cultural currents that have defined and challenged American society and literature from the postCivil-War period to the present. We will consider the role of race, gender, class, and region in the invention and reinvention of American literature and American identity. The novels we'll read register radical shifts in American society, offer brave and impactful critiques of American culture, and make room for provocative questions and new perspectives.

## LITS3601:   AFRICAN LITERATURE I

This course is intended as an introduction to the study of African literature in English, with reference to selected texts by important writers such as Achebe and Soyinka.  The focus of the  course  (e.g.  the  'Aesthetics  of  African  Literature')  varies  from  year  to  year.    The representation of colonialism, nationalism, and neo-colonialism is a recurring theme.  We will also examine the issues of tradition and modernity, gender politics, and the politics of literary form in African literature.

## LITS3604:   CREATIVE NONFICTION AND DIGITAL MEDIA

Moving from print to digital media means new possibilities, audiences and creative projects for writers. The course teaches students the fundamentals of good writing across various non-fiction genres including the personal essay, narrative essay, general interest criticism and literary journalism, all of which allow for effective digital content creation (i.e., vlogging,

Return to Table of Content

podcasting, or blogging).  Students are introduced to online platforms for writing and guided through  the  process  of  developing  and  completing  their  own  digital  media  projects. Students will gain experience through all stages of the writing process (drafting, receiving feedback, revising), while becoming skilled and knowledgeable users of digital media, from designing multimodal texts to using social and promotional tools to reach audiences.

## LITS3605:  CREATIVE WRITING SENIOR PROJECT

This capstone creative writing course enables students to propose, develop, and complete a project comprised of original creative writing in their chosen genre: poetry, prose, creative nonfiction,  drama,  or  screenwriting.  This  is  a  workshop  course  in  which  students  are required  to  write  regularly  and  to  submit  new  pieces  of  original  work  for  workshop discussion. Assessment for the course is based on attendance and participation (students must provide consistent and substantive feedback on the writing of their peers), a project proposal, and a final manuscript submission. The manuscript consists of a single long work or a collection of short, related works and a critical reflection. The critical reflection explains and  justifies  the  decisions  made  with  regard  to  subject  matter,  formal  elements,  and organization  of  the  manuscript,  and  articulates  the  way  in  which  a  project  fist  within, responds to, or challenges literary models and traditions.

## LITS3701:   AFRICAN-AMERICAN LITERATURE

This  course  focuses  on  a  selection  of  literature  by  African  American  writers  from  the antebellum period to the present. In exploring the emergence and evolution of a distinct African  American  literary  tradition,  we  will  give  attention  to  the  historical  and  political contexts  and  consider  intersections  of  racial  identity  with  issues  of  class,  gender,  and sexuality. We'll consider the role of African American literature in the struggle for political freedom and equality and the work of this literature to challenge and redefine what it means to be American.

## LITS3702:   AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN WRITERS

This course explores the writings of African-American women writers with an emphasis on works created in the 20 th  century. Through close readings, students will trace thematic and stylistic  similarities  and  differences  among the texts,  with a  consideration  of  the  social, economic, political, sexual and gender parameters of African American women's written expression.  The literature examined will include autobiography, drama, fiction and poetry.

## LITS3801:   ENVIRONMENTAL LITERATURE

The relationship between 'man and nature' is a recurring theme in many national literatures, and  has  been  expressed  in  both  utopian  and  dystopian  manners.  This  course  frames Environmental Literature as a subset of Utopian and Dystopian writing. It surveys mostly late twentieth- and early twenty-first century "nature writing," introducing this body of work as having intertextual relationships with other eras and non-Western cultural traditions (the Biblical world; indigenous spirituality, etc.). Recent criticism notes Environmental Literature's affiliation with post-colonial studies. That is both fields attempt to listen to a previously  silenced  "other,"  and  provide  de-centred  opposition  to  (or  alternatives  to) destructive systems. Making visible such affiliations beyond the scope of Environmental Literature proper, will be a central aim of this course.

## LITS3806:   POPULAR FILM AND IDEOLOGY

This course is about movies and how they create meaning and pleasure for the spectator. We are particularly interested in how movies suggest and reflect social values or ideology. Ideology may be defined as a set of ideas which explains the social world, and which as a result  indicates,  explicitly  or  implicitly,  how  power  is  or  should  be  distributed.  Often dismissed as mere entertainment and regarded as politically neutral, movies in fact may act as powerful vehicles of ideology, and help shape our thinking about ourselves and the world around us. The course will involve the study of a broad range of popular films drawn from a variety of film genres.

## LITS3911:    MAJOR AUTHORS: WILLIAM BUTLER YEATS

The course explores the poetry of W.B. Yeats, examining work from the three major periods of his oeuvre, and locating him within the literary and cultural contexts of Modernism and the Irish Renaissance.  The course will also discuss the major critical response to Yeats' poetry,  as  part  of  an  attempt to  assess the  nature  and  the extent of  his  contribution  to Literatures in English

## PUBL1001:   THE WORLD OF PUBLISHING

The course will begin with a brief history of the book that will situate the art and business of book publishing within a broad socio-political context. It will identify major innovations and advances in publishing over the last 500 years, with emphasis on the introduction of new technologies in the late 20 th   and  21 st   centuries.  Students  will  be  introduced  to  the requirements  and  demands  of  the  main  categories  of  modern  book  publishing,  namely trade/commercial, scholarly and educational publishing, with attention paid to the stages and  phases  of  production  involved  in  each  of  these  categories.  The  course  will  also introduce students to the language and terminology of the publishing world as well as the roles of various players involved in the enterprise of publishing.

## PUBL2001: PUBLISHING IN THE CARIBBEAN: FROM IDEA TO PRODUCT

Building  on  the  introductory  knowledge  gained  in  the  Level  1  course  (PUBL1001),  this course focuses more specifically on the processes involved in carrying a product from idea to publication within the context of book publishing in the Caribbean. The course develops a more detailed understanding of the varied and multiple tasks, activities and steps involved in book publishing with particular emphasis on identifying and responding to the specific conditions  and  challenges  encountered  in  the  Caribbean.  The  course  begins  with  an overview of publishing in the Caribbean that will consider the performance of traditional and non-tradition publishing and products, as well as the potential for growth and expansion. Students  are  also  oriented  with  regard  to  the  impact  of  publishing  on  the  cultural  and intellectual development of the region. The course will go on to provide students with insight into  the  steps  involved  in  the  publishing  process,  identified  here  as  (i)  Acquisition  (ii) Editorial  &amp;  Production  and  (iii)  Marketing  and  Distribution.  Consideration  is  given  to  the exploration of innovative practices in all phases of the process, including the use of new technologies to increase efficiency, non-traditional approaches to marketing and strategies to develop new content.

## PUBL3001: APPLIED MARKETING AND FINANCE IN PUBLISHING

The course explores the critical functions of marketing and finance in the publishing cycle (the stages through which a book typically moves in the course of its life history), and by extension, the publishing chain (the interconnected organizations involved in the publishing, selling and distribution of books). The focus will be on Marketing and Finance as two crucial considerations in the decision-making process in the assessment of unsolicited manuscript submissions, as well as commissioned works, with regard to the potential to produce the work at a cost and sell it at a price that is profitable. The course will take students through the process of assessing and evaluating the contributing factors to this equation, namely, the potential market for the work, the availability and affordability of the resources to exploit that potential, and the work's compatibility with the publisher's existing list. Attention will also be paid to the global shift in the publishing industry, evident since the late 1970s, in which marketing and finance, rather than content, are frequently the primary considerations in the decision to publish.

## PUBL3002:  CURRENT TRENDS AND ISSUES IN PUBLISHING

The course begins by introducing students to the requirements of the research paper, the major  piece  of  assessment.  Recognising  publishing  as  a  critical  factor  in  a  society's intellectual  growth  and  development,  the  course  introduces  a  historical  framework  that identifies Caribbean publishing as an industry built on a colonial model characterized by the importation and production of printed material for the pleasure of the planter class. The course then proceeds to examine the modern push to transform the industry in order to meet the needs and demands of the postcolonial, globally connected Caribbean consumer. This  dynamic  of  changing  modes  of  production  and  consumption  over  time  is  the background against which the course will explore current trends and issues in the modern Caribbean publishing industry including:

- (i) the  growth  of  an  increasingly  educated  Caribbean  population  and  the  demand  for affordable books (and book formats] that reflect their interests and realities;
- (ii) the  rise  of  publishing  in  the  modern  Caribbean,  including  the  trend  towards  selfpublishing;
- (iii) the global digital revolution and its impact on publishing, education and literacy;
- (iv) the need for increased innovation, entrepreneurship, legal and financial literacy in the regional industry in order to meet the challenges of 21st century publishing;
- (v) ethical publishing in the context of concerns about environmental sustainability and climate change.

## PUBL3003: EDITING &amp; PROOF READING

This course introduces students to the business and craft of editing and proofreading for writing  across  a  number  of  genres,  including  creative  non-fiction,  academic  writing, journalism and public relations communications. The course first provides a survey of the approaches to editorial practice and an overview of the business of editing. Students will then be introduced to the craft of copy editing, with a focus on the technical elements of proofreading based on selected style guides, notably the Associated Press Style Guide and the Chicago Manual of Style.

## MESSAGE FROM HEAD OF DEPARTMENT

## DR. TERESA VILLORIA NOLLA

Welcome to the Department of Modern Languages and Literatures! We are a dynamic, international and studentcentred team committed to developing linguistic, literary and cultural competence in individuals, who also think critically and communicate effectively in local, national and  global  communities.  In  an  increasingly  diverse world,  the  study  of  foreign  languages  is  critical  to engaging us in our global society, preparing us to live, work  and  lead  as informed  citizens. As  language, literature and culture are deeply intertwined, to advance the linguistic and cultural competencies in one or more

foreign languages offers students new perspectives and the right tools to succeed in further studies and careers.

Mastering languages not only includes competence in speaking and writing proficiency in the target language but also increases one's appreciation and critical analysis of the literatures and cultures that share that language. Through an interdisciplinary approach, collaborative work and autonomous learning, our faculty members seek to develop students as world citizens helping them to acquire  knowledge, awareness  and empathy  towards other  communities, enhancing critical thinking and effective communication in culturally sensitive ways.

The Department's enthusiastic atmosphere and the extensive exposure to the target language and culture, through new initiatives and practices.  We equip students beyond functioning in the language, by preparing them to perform effectively in a globalized and complex world, gaining a genuine  appreciation  of  difference  and  increasing  their  potential  for  economic  and  social development within and outside the Caribbean. Our students can compete in both private and public sectors, as national and international organizations view knowledge of foreign languages and the cultural awareness that goes along with it as a feature that enhances the value of a potential employee. Our graduates have found careers in not only education (translation and interpretation, research, teaching, library work, etc.) and the arts, but also beyond the humanities in diplomacy, business and industry, social work, tourism and travel.

The Department of Modern Languages and Literatures provides students with proficient and intercultural competence necessary for the global society of the 21st Century, motivating and inspiring students to interact with people from other countries and cultures. I assure that your journey with us will be a memorable experience.  Have a great academic year 2024-2025!

Have a great Academic Year 2024-2025!

## MESSAGE FROM THE DIRECTOR OF THE SCHOOL

## DR. MARCIA RAINFORD

On behalf of the staff of the School of Education (SOE) it is with great pleasure that I welcome all students to the Faculty of Humanities and Education  as  incoming  Director  of  the  SOE.    I  also  extend  a  very special  welcome to the new students who have elected to pursue studies in Education and to the graduate students who are studying at the UWI for the first time.

The School of Education serves a fairly wide cross section of persons - pre-trained and trained teachers, teacher educators, educational leaders and other professionals at all levels of the education system.  We are mindful of the fact that there are several options available for furthering your studies and yet you have made a choice to pursue studies at the UWI.   We are therefore committed to providing quality education for all our students through the wide range of programmes, offered via various modalities at the undergraduate and graduate levels.

If  you  are  an  undergraduate,  you  are  either  an  aspiring  teacher  who  has  decided  to  do  the  Bachelor  of Education (B.Ed.) degree to become professionally certified or you are already teacher-trained but need to upgrade your status from a teaching diploma to a Bachelor's degree.   While some postgraduate students are here for professional certification, the majority of you are here to pursue Masters or Doctoral degrees for career advancement.

We continue to take steps to improve the services we offer to our students. These include:

-  upgrading our website to provide more information on the courses and programmes we offer, and the research and outreach projects being conducted in the School.
-  expanding  the  reach  of  our  programmes  in  Jamaica  and  the  Caribbean  through  the  use  of  webconferencing technology. The Bachelor of Education (B.Ed.) In-service programme is showing steady growth in Mathematics, English and Social Studies Education. This programme is offered on a part time basis by blended delivery to teachers who need to obtain the B.Ed. degree but are unable to get leave to pursue full time study at this time.  For the past 6 years the SOE has also offered the Post Graduate Diploma in Education by blended delivery to students in countries such as Jamaica, St. Lucia, Dominica, Montserrat, Bermuda and the Cayman Islands through the MEd summer and online Unit.
-  increasing the number of Master of Education (M.Ed.) degree programmes.  This year we will offer the MEd in Education for Sustainable Development, Global Citizenship and Peace for the first time.  We also anticipate offering for the first time, the MEd in Special Education to a group of students from Belize.
-  constantly  upgrading  our  facilities  to  ensure  that  the  learning  environment  is  aesthetically  pleasing, comfortable  and  technologically  adequate.    Our  newest  classroom,  SLT4,  boasts  cutting  edge technology for the delivery of classes by web conferencing.

I  hope  that  your  UWI  experience  will  be  rich,  rewarding  and  memorable.    While  you  give  priority  to  your academic pursuits, I encourage you to strike the right balance and also to get involved with university life. Make use of the range of opportunities for service, fun and personal development. Try to interact meaningfully with the wide cross-section of students who are also here. These interactions can be the start of lasting friendships and professional networks.   Take advantage of the student advising sessions and other activities at orientation to obtain accurate information on your programmes.  Become familiar with the resources in the libraries,  come prepared for classes and above all approach your studies with diligence, honesty and the utmost integrity.

I wish you a very productive and rewarding academic year.

PRACTICUM:  THE  FIELD  PRACTICE  COMPONENT  OF  THE  B.ED.  DEGREE : Like  traditional professions such as law, medicine, and the clergy, teaching is a practice-based profession. All students (completing a major in any of the nine (9) option areas for the Bachelors of Education degree programme)  are required to complete the specified practicum course/credits/hours required  for  each  level  of  study.  These  practicum  courses  can  be found on the course selection guideline sheet for each option. Students MUST read through the Practicum/Field Experience  handbook provided at the School of Education to ensure that they are aware of what is required of them as they engage with various aspects of the practicum experience. Information on the Practicum handbook can be attained from the administrators at the front desk on the top floor of the School of Education building and from the SOE's online portal.

## B.ed. COMPUTER SCIENCE OPTION

The  Bachelor  of  Education  in  Computer  Science/  Information  Technology  is  a  professional degree which is normally intended for practitioners in the field of education. The programme aims  to  address  the  needs  of  the  Caribbean  region  and  produce  graduates  who  have  been exposed  to  experiences  that  will prepare  them  to  address  the  information  processing requirements of organizations. It is designed to meet the ever changing and evolving needs of teachers of Computer Science, and to stimulate their commitment to lifelong learning. It seeks also to sharpen their awareness of the need to be in the forefront of development and change in education if they are to remain relevant in the classroom.

## B.ed. GEOGRAPHY EDUCATION OPTION

Geography is concerned with people and place. It enables students to see how people adapt to their environment and how human activities are modified by the environment; it fosters abstract thinking as students master geographical concepts; it also provides the opportunity for students to critically think about, and examine, issues and social problems affecting their community/society.  Through  geographical  enquiry  students  learn  to  observe  record,  make inferences and draw conclusions.

## B.ed. LANGUAGE EDUCATION: ENGLISH  OPTION

The  Language  Education  programme  is  designed  to  promote  the  teaching  of  language  and literature  through  eclectic  pedagogical  frames  which  promote  functional,  contextual,  and relevant  approaches  and  strategies  for  teaching  and  learning  English  Language  and  English Literature.  Our  perspective  on  language  and  literature  learning  and  teaching  is  markedly pedagogical and informed by an awareness of the role social context plays in the learning and teaching  of  English  in  a  Creole  speaking  environment.  There  is  a  rich  blend  of  the  study  of language and literature that is informed by research, policy, and praxis.

NOTE:  It  is  important  that  students  pursue  courses  as  prescribed  in  the  following  course selection  guide.  All  new  students  must seek  academic advising  before  course registration  is completed.

## B.ed. LANGUAGE EDUCATION: LITERACY STUDIES OPTION

The B.Ed. Literacy Studies programme is designed to develop knowledge and expertise in literacy learning and instruction. It aims to help students to understand the principles of literacy within a Creole-speaking  environment.    The  programme  introduces  students  to  literacy  concepts, strategies,  and  develops  in  students  the  knowledge,  attitude  and  professional  development needed  to  organize  and  support  literacy  programmes  within  institutions.    And  finally,  the programme helps students to engage in intellectual and practical processes to enhance their roles in literacy development.

## B.ed. MATHEMATICS EDUCATION OPTION

Mathematics  is  a  core  subject  at  the  primary  and  secondary  levels  of  education.  Research findings indicate that teaching and teacher quality have a significant impact on students' learning of  and engagement with mathematics. Teachers, therefore, need to understand how children learn mathematics and garner effective, research-based strategies for teaching the subject.

Key  developments  in  Mathematics  Education  currently  are  the  promotion  of  interactive mathematics,  an  increased  emphasis  on  problem-solving  and  investigations,  and  the  use  of technology, as well as other tools such as mathematics manipulatives in the classroom. To this end, the courses in the Mathematics Education option incorporate these developments and build on students' current knowledge and experience. Another important focus of the programme is to encourage self-sustained professional development both during and after the period of study.

## B.ed. SCIENCE EDUCATION OPTION

The concentration in Science is designed to meet the needs of the teacher and other qualified educators  who  want  to  pursue  a  first  degree  in  Education  with  strong  subject  content.    In developing countries such as those in the Caribbean, there is an urgent need for the citizens to appreciate how much the principles of science can be applied in many aspects of their daily activities.  Science teachers play a central role in achieving this objective.  In many of our schools, students complain that science is difficult and uninteresting and too often students are unable to apply the principles of science in relevant areas of their everyday lives.

The Bachelor of Education (B.Ed.) in Science programme offers teachers opportunities to deepen their  knowledge  of  the  nature,  scope  and  applications  of  science.    In  addition,  it  provides opportunities for teachers to develop competencies in a wide array of strategies and techniques suitable for engaging the learner in meaningful teaching/learning activities.

## B.ed. SOCIAL STUDIES OPTION

Social Studies and Geography are two options in the Education-based programme which provide professional training for  teachers.  Through a  range  of  courses,  students/teachers obtain  the necessary knowledge and skills in teaching both Social Studies and Geography at the secondary level. Geography is an old established discipline while Social Studies is relatively new with its development  as  an  academic  discipline  going  back  to  the  nineteen  fifties  (1950's)  in  the Commonwealth Caribbean.

NOTE:  It  is  important  that  students  pursue  courses  as  prescribed  in  the  following  course selection  guide.  All  new  students  must seek  academic advising  before  course registration  is completed.

Please Note: a course activity such as microteaching is regarded as 'supervised work' and is allocated two hours per credit. Field based work such as the practicum is regarded as 'directed  learning  activities'  as  set out  in  the  Definition  of  Credit  Hours  by  the  Office  of Administration, and is accorded 3 hours per credit (Office of Administration, UWI, 2015). The final practicum was computed at 4 hrs per credit, however.

## EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION

<!-- image -->

## EDEA2304:  INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION

The administration function in the school system has become more demanding as efforts are made to improve performance in all aspects of schooling.  How schools are organized and  programmes  are  administered  will  to  a  great  extent  determine  the  quality  of performance and overall output.  Currently, there are persons in posts with responsibility for supervising  both  academic  and  non-academic  staff,  but  their  skills  are  mainly  honed through trial and error or experience through learning on the job.  While valuable learning does occur through these approaches, there is no substitute for systematic and deliberate training  in  educational  administration.  Experience  along  with  the  findings  of  numerous research studies, has demonstrated that administrative skills are essential at all levels of the school system.  It is therefore, imperative that training in educational administration starts with the classroom teachers.  The neophyte administrator or those who have desires to  become  school  administrators  will  also  gain  valuable  competencies  preparing  for leadership responsibilities.  Similarly, those who are already practicing administrators and have not gone through formal training will benefit just as well.  The course is designed to be reflective and interactive; therefore, participants will benefits from the experiences that will be shared by persons from the different types and levels of schools

## EDEA2305:  ACTION RESEARCH FOR SCHOOL AND CLASSROOM MANAGERS

The critical  need  to  improve  the  quality  of  education  output  to  meet  the  demands  of  a changing world requires teachers and school managers who have the ability to solve school and  classroom  problems.    Consequently,  a  course  in  action  research  must  be  a  vital component in the education and training of school and classroom managers.  The solutions to the day to day problems of the school require a systematic approach to problem solving. A course designed to equip school and classroom managers with research skills will enable them to do their jobs better.

It  is  no secret that over the years many teachers and administrators have used trial and error in the way they respond to school based problems and, as many have expressed, with less than satisfactory results.  Action research looks at problems in a particular setting, in this  case,  the  school,  and  provides  the  tool  to  engender  the  professional  growth  and development of school personnel in ways that facilitate improved teaching and learning. Through this course teacher can see themselves as teacher researchers enabling change in their classrooms.

## EDEA3304:  MANAGEMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES AND INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIP

Managing people at work is one the most important roles of the organization leader.  The principal  as  human  resource  manager  must  acquire  the  skills  to  enable  the  effective development of staff and students in order to facilitate the achievement of school's goals. Understanding  the  principles  of  staffing  and  the  maintenance  of  good  interpersonal

relations  and  relationships,  can  help  participants  to  become  good  human  resource managers.

## EDEA3305:  SPECIAL PROBLEMS IN SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION

The Jamaican education system is currently on a path of far reaching transformation in order to improve the performance of all aspects of life in the country.  The Task Force on Education  Reform  (2004)  report  indicated  that  at  all  levels  of  the  school  system-early childhood  to  the  tertiary--performance  has  been  far  below  expectations.    Educators operating at the level of the school (whether as teachers, senior staff, vice principals or principals) should recognize that it is not sufficient to have only a peripheral knowledge of the changes now taking place, but it is obligatory for them to have a profound knowledge these changes and be prepared to become a part of the change process.  This course will give  students  an  opportunity  to  explore  the  change  and  transformation  process  being implemented through direct interviews with personnel involved in the process. In addition, relevant documentations will be examined as part of the investigative process. The findings resulting  from  the  information  and  data  gathering  effort  will  be  shared  with  your  peers through a process of reflection and discussion.

## EDEA3306:  SCHOOL AND CLASSROOM MANAGEMENT A

For persons who are pursuing a programme of training in educational administration, it is important that they acquire the skills and competencies  for effective classroom management,  because  the  classroom  represents  the  core  unit  of  all  school.  It  follows therefore that if the activities of the classroom are not being implemented with the desired success,  then  the  performance  of  school  and  students  alike  would  be  jeopardized.    In addition to the need for administrators to understand the critical role of the classroom, they should be prepared to apply scientific approaches to the monitoring and evaluating of the teachers, who have primary responsibility for the effective management of the classroom. The  teachers  at  the  same  time  must  also  acquire  classroom  management  skills  and competencies to function in a scientific manner. At present, most school administrators and teachers do not have the breadth and depth of competencies and abilities to create the learning  environment  necessary  to  achieve  optimum  classroom  performance  by  their students. Based on the limitations outlined, this course is geared at preparing both school administrators and teachers to improve the performance of students in the classroom by applying the essential principles of classroom management. Buttressed by theories rooted in the effective classroom management, the students also be prepared to solve intractable problems being experienced in the classrooms and schools alike.

## EDEA3307:  SCHOOL AND CLASSROOM MANAGEMENT B

The management of schools requires a mix of technical, relational and conceptual skills by school leaders/administrators in order to achieve maximum performance in all aspects of their operations.  A school is recognized as effective based on factors such as how well students are performing academically, their preparedness to function at each level of the school system, and their readiness to function in the world of work.  This course covers all aspects needed for managing a school to become an effective learning entity.  Bearing in mind that the role of the administrator is the single most important ingredient in determining the success or failure of the school, the course will be focused on the vital administrative responsibilities.

## EDEA3308:  PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES IN SCHOOL FINANCE

This is an introductory course in the area of School Finance aimed at enabling participants to  develop  an  understanding  of  the  functions,  principles,  processes  and  strategies  of managing school finance efficiently according to established guidelines. In the context of developing countries where resources are scarce and planning has not been routinized in the education system, those who manage educational systems and org reality is that those who manage educational organizations and institutions should have insights into policies, practices and strategies for managing school finances and should also be equipped with the knowledge and skills for managing the organization's financial resources efficiently and effectively.  The  course  is  therefore  designed  to  equip  practitioners  with  the  requisite knowledge, skills and experiences necessary to become successful school administrators.

Language content is the second area of focus, ranging from the nature of grammar content to the writing genres of CXC. Pedagogy is the final phase where students evaluate methods of  language  teaching  for  the  senior  grades  in  a  Creole-speaking  environment,  focus  on classroom-based assessment for CXC English Language and engage in unit and syllabus planning, while evaluating CXC language texts.

## EDLA3109: TEACHING THE STRUCTURE OF ENGLISH

This is a yearlong course that is taught over two semesters. During the first half of the course, students investigate different second language acquisition theories and other key concepts  to  better  understand  the  teaching  of  English  in  our  Creole-speaking  context. Thereafter,  students  reflect  on  their  own  language  journey  and  think  about  the  learning needs of their students. Finally, students read about and demonstrate different strategies to  help  improve  comprehension  skills,  grammar  and  writing  in  the  English  language classroom. In the second half of the course, students identify key historical themes related to the teaching of English in colonial and post-colonial Jamaica. They then review current English  language  curricula  at  the  secondary  level.  Finally,  students  reflect  on  their  own professional  identity  and  development  as  English  language  teachers  by  looking  at leadership in the classroom space.

## EDLA3110:  WRITING IN THE SECONDARY SCHOOL

A majority of students at the secondary level continue to struggle with writing, a situation which many teachers are often ill-equipped to address.  Consequently, this dis-ease with writing is transferred beyond the English Language, English Literature and Communication Studies classrooms, to the other disciplines, and sometimes with devastating consequences  to  students'  writing  development.    So  as  to  transform  this  situation  for students to develop an appreciation for the art of writing by engaging with the practice of writing, teachers must be taught pedagogical strategies for enabling students' writing.

## EDRS3019:  THE TEACHER AS REFLECTIVE PRACTITIONER: THE REPORT

EDRS3019  represents  the  capstone  course  for  the  two  -  year  Bachelor  of  Education Programme. It completes the undergraduate phase of the preparation of diploma certified teachers  as  reflective  practitioners  and  teacher  researchers.  The  course  guides  them towards the completion of a written report through workshops and seminars which are designed to address different components of the action research report.  This report is linked to and derived from their practicum teaching intervention in their subject discipline and will therefore be related to an issue or problem of practice within their subject area. This issue they examined in their capacity as certified teachers familiar with classroom related teaching-learning events but now equipped to employ the action research process to engage  in  evidence-based  teaching.  The  action  research  report  is  expected  to demonstrate how reflection as a theoretical construct is operationalized in practice, while encapsulating the meaning of teacher research in the actual end product of the course itself.

## EDRS3020:  RESEARCH TEACHING: THE STUDY

EDRS3020  represents  the  capstone  course  for  the  three-year  Bachelor  of  Education Programme.  It completes the undergraduate phase of students' preparation as reflective practitioners begun in year one of the programme.  The course guides them towards the completion of a written study (a lesson study) through workshops and seminars which are designed to address different components of the research study.  This study is linked to and derived from their practicum teaching in their subject discipline and will therefore be related to an issue or topic within their subject area which poses a challenge for them as novice teachers or which they are interested in exploring in the classroom.  The capstone study is expected to demonstrate how theoretical reflection is operationalized in practice, while encapsulating the meaning of teacher research in the actual product of the course itself.

## EDTL3018:  CULMINATING SCHOOL BASED EXPERIENCE: CLINICAL PRACTICE

In the courses completed in years one and two, teacher candidates have been introduced

to the field of education and some of the key skills that teachers are expected to acquire. This present  course  prepares  them  through  a  series  of  workshops/seminars  and subject/option-based tutorials to enter into and be immersed in the field for an extended period of time - 10 weeks in the first semester of their final year of the programme. In this embedded internship, student-teachers will observe mentor teachers teach, and they will themselves spend many hours planning and practicing teaching with supervisory support. As initial teacher education students, they will have opportunities to develop relationships at  all  levels  within  the  school  environment  [virtual  and  physical],  to  both  embrace  and critique the culture of schools, and make a meaningful contribution to both teaching and non-teaching activities, this also providing benefits for the cooperating schools.

## EDTL3020:  PREPARING FOR THE FIELD: THE TEACHER AS RESEARCHER

The  course  examines  classroom  teaching  and  learning  through  the  lens  of  reflective practice and educational action research. Participants will engage in activities to foster selfreflection, auto critique and examination of the sources of influence on teaching practice.

Case studies, video clips and movies of classroom practice are examples of teaching/learning artefacts to be employed to concretize the abstract concepts of teacher reflection and to illustrate teacher research in action.

## EDTL3021:  IN THE FIELD: TEACHING AS EXPERIMENT

The course continues the examination of the concept of reflective practice and teacher researcher begun in EDTL3020 and engage participants in an examination of the theory and practice of classroom observation which is fundamental to both concepts. The groundwork is laid for teachers in the course to understand what teaching as experiment looks like as they learn how to 'try' out innovative or newly learnt teaching/learning strategies, concepts, or  theories  in  classrooms  while  engaging  ethically  in  gathering  data  for  the  purpose  of analysis and interpretation. Classroom teaching is guided by an intervention plan, derived from  pre-teaching  observation  and  modelled  on  the  action  research  cycle.  The  cycle involves observation, planning the intervention, implementing and collecting data, reviewing the results and taking actions informed by the findings.

## EDPS1003:  PSYCHOLOGICAL ISSUES IN THE CLASSROOM

This course is designed to introduce students to selected theories of psychology and their impact on teaching and learning environments. Special emphasis is placed on the dynamics of classroom communication.  It is intended that in this course you will examine certain classroom events and case studies with a view to developing your analytical skills, thereby coming to appreciate how knowledge of psychology can inform their classroom practice. Readings and related activities highlight the nature of the learner, the psychological factors important in the teaching, learning process, and appropriate methods of instruction that facilitate learning.

## EDME2006:  CLASSROOM TESTING AND EVALUATION

This Course  will provide student teachers with foundational skills in testing and measurement to allow them to plan, construct and administer 'good tests' in the context of their classrooms.  The main concerns of the Course are essential to the teachers' toolkit and will enable them to effectively assess how well teaching and learning is taking place in their classrooms. To account for the changes in the field of testing and measurement the Course includes a brief discussion of some contemporary trends in testing and evaluation such as accountability and standards, and what these mean for the classroom teacher. The differences between teacher-made classroom tests and high-stakes standardized tests will also be highlighted, preparing teachers to understand better how to use and interpret the results  of  standardized  tests.    In  this  regard,  the  Course  also  includes  a  Statistical

component to help them understand how to evaluate,  interpret  and  report  on  students' scores.

## EDPS2003:  MOTIVATION AND THE TEACHER

The course introduces psychology as a fundamental discipline, one which is essential to understanding the phenomenon of human behaviour. Specifically, Educational Psychology focuses on the teaching/learning situation. It is intended that in this course students will examine  certain  classroom  situations  and  come  to  appreciate  how  knowledge  of psychology can inform their classroom practice.

## EDRS2007:  RESEARCH DESIGN IN EDUCATION

The  course  introduces  the  elements  of  the  research  process  within  quantitative  and qualitative approaches. Participants will be provided with the opportunity to understand the language  of  research  and  ethical  principles.  The  course  will  be  presented  sequentially helping students to identify a research topic, formulate research questions and hypotheses, organize literature review and select appropriate research design. The course will introduce students to Action Research, which facilitates improvement in teachers own practices. They will learn how to ask focusing questions, define terms, collect relevant data, and use an analysis  process  to  solve  problems  and  improve  professional  practices  in  their  own classrooms;  the  findings  from  Action  Research  become  immediately  applicable  to educators' individual situations.

## EDCU2013 (ED20M):  INTRODUCTION TO CURRICULUM STUDIES

Through the curriculum, educational goals and objectives can be realized but this depends on the teachers' interpretations of curriculum and the extent to which they understand and use  principles  which  guide  curriculum  decision-making.  This  course  is  designed  to introduce teachers to those principles, to the various factors, which influence the curriculum and  to  certain  issues,  which  impact  on  curriculum  in  its  various  forms.  Improved understanding  of  curriculum,  a  greater  sense  of  empowerment  and  a  more  rational approach to teaching should result from participation in this course.

## Objectives

This course seeks to enable participants to:

-  explore different conceptions of curriculum
-  examine various factors which influence curriculum decision-making
-  formulate different types of objectives and varying levels in the domains
-  select content for teaching or using appropriate criteria
-  apply principles of instruction in lesson planning and development
-  critically examine issues which impact on the curriculum
-  plan for more effective teaching and evaluation of lessons
-  reflect on their role in implementing innovations in their classrooms

Demographic and socio-economic shifts in our population, as well as changes in our family structure have placed increasing demands on the school system. Perhaps, none is as great as the task of dealing with the increased incidence of aggression and violence. Teachers indeed need to be better equipped to cope with resulting problems and to help children to deal with issues which lead to such disruptive behaviour.

## THEO3313:   THEOLOGY OF SACRAMENTAL WORSHIP

This course is designed to provide systematic theological foundation for Pastoral courses THEO2201 (T22A) Rites of Christian Initiation and THEO2202 (T22B) Christian Sacramental Rites. It addresses  in  both  historical  and  systematic  manner  the  questions  which throughout  the  centuries  have  been  raised  concerning  the  nature  and  meaning  of sacramental  worship,  its  casualty  and  effects,  including  new  insights  thrown  on  these questions by the behavioural sciences.

## THEO3314:   WOMEN RELIGION AND LIBERATION

This  course  aims  to  inform  students  about  the  historical,  cultural  and  religious  factors which have influenced the assumptions about the status of women and their function in human society. Biblical images of women are examined through the lens of a hermeneutic informed by a Caribbean female theological perspective.

## THEO3318:   CARIBBEAN THEOLOGY

This  course  is  a  study  of  the  chronology  and  development  of  indigenous  theological perspectives in the Caribbean context. Assuming that missionary evangelization with its association  with  colonization  is  the  chief  percipient  towards  the  emergence  of  these perspectives,  the  course  will  begin  with  an  examination  of  the  effects  of  missionary theology on the Caribbean church, society and culture in general. It will also explore how the faith tensions between acculturation and enculturation have influenced new methodologies in theologizing on the social, economic, political and religious issues of the contemporary Caribbean.

## THEO1401:    INTRODUCTION TO THE STUDY OF RELIGION

An Introduction to the major beliefs and practices of World Religions (with emphasis on their  Caribbean  manifestations)  and  to  anthropological,  sociological,  psychological  and philosophical issues to which religious belief gives rise.

## THEO1404:    HISTORY OF WESTERN PHILOSOPHY I

An  introduction  to  philosophy  using  selected  writings  from  philosophers  in  the  ancient period of Western Philosophy. After a brief study of the Pre-Socratics, the major emphasis of the course will be on readings of selected texts of Plato and Aristotle. The course will end with a survey of philosophical movements of the Hellenistic period up to Plotinus.

## THEO1405:    HISTORY OF WESTERN PHILOSOPHY II

An  introduction  to  modern  and  contemporary  philosophy  using  selected  writings  from philosophers  of  these  periods.  The  course  will  concentrate  on  the  contributions  of Descartes, Hume, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, and will end with a survey of trends in the 20 th century philosophy.

## THEO1407:    TRADITIONAL LOGIC

The aim of the course is twofold: first, to introduce, through a historical and problematic approach, the methods and terminology of formal logic, particularly as it finds its origins in the  philosophy of Aristotle;  secondly,  trace  the  development,  uses  and  criticisms  of  the Aristolean  'scientific'  model,  both  in  the  subsequent  history  of  philosophy,  and  in  the implicit presuppositions of other disciplines. The student should develop, therefore, not only the fundamental skills of argument analysis, but also a critical attitude concerning the limits of formal logic.

## THEO2405:    PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION

The examination of a variety of psychological perspectives and development theories and their application to religion and to individuals' religious thought and behaviour. Religious experiences and beliefs will be examined in the light of major theories of topics such as motivation and emotion, and approaches to the study of personality.

## LEVEL III

## THEO3405:    ASPECTS OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF AQUINAS

The object of this course is to familiarize the student with certain selected text of Aquinas on the structure of thought, the structure of things in general, the ladder of being and mind, and enable the student to understand them against the background of Medieval philosophy and relate them to contemporary thinking. It is hoped that this course will help the student towards clarity of thought and an orderly mind.

## DEAN S HONOUR ROLL '

The  Dean's  Honour  Roll  represents  one  of  the  ways  in  which  the  Faculty  recognizes undergraduate students who have excelled academically in each of the regular semesters of the academic year. Students are deemed eligible for inclusion on the Dean's Honour Roll if they satisfy the following criteria:

- (i) Students must have earned a (semester) GPA of 3.6 and above for the applicable semester.
- (ii) Courses taken during the summer period (Summer School) shall not be considered.
- (iii) Students must have completed a minimum of three courses (i.e. nine credit hours) for the applicable semester. Preliminary and co-curricular courses shall not be taken into consideration in the calculation of courses taken or credit hours earned.
- (iv) Students must have completed in a satisfactory manner all courses for which they were registered during the applicable semester.
- (v) Repeat courses shall not be included in the calculation of credits for the Dean's Honour Roll.

## Guidelines for Publication

Students who have met the above criteria shall be notified by the Faculty via email (UWI assigned email addresses only).

The Dean's Honour Roll shall be posted on the Faculty's website as well as on designated notice boards within the Faculty at least four (4) weeks after the University's deadline for the posting of final grades for the applicable semester. Once posted, the published Dean's List shall not be updated based on late changes to any student's academic record except in instances where a student's name was inadvertently placed on the published List.

## Omission from Publication List

The Faculty makes every effort to ensure that the names of all eligible students are included on the Dean's List. Occasionally, a student's name may be omitted for reasons that do not relate to a failure to meet the criteria. Two (2) such reasons are:

- (i) Access to grades were restricted
- (ii) Late submission of grades

Students who feel that they have been omitted from the List in error may send a request for consideration to fhe@uwimona.edu.jm If a student was left off the published Dean's List, the Faculty's records will be amended accordingly. However, the student's name shall not be added to the published (printed) Dean's List (see above guidelines for publication)

## Clubs and societieS

Student life in the Faculty of Humanities and Education, and by extension, at The UWI, is not only about academics.  Students are therefore encouraged to balance their studies with extracurricular activities. One way to do this is to get involved in one of the following student clubs and societies here in the Faculty:

-  CARIMAC Student Society
-  Chinese Club
-  ECEM Society
-  French Club
-  History and Archaeology Society
-  Japanese Club
-  LOUD - Linguistics Club
-  Philosophy Society
-  Spanish Club
-  UWI LISS (Library &amp; Information Studies Society)
-  Writers' Circle

## TERMS ASSOCIATED WITH GRADE POINT AVERAGE (GPA)

Credit  Hours  Earned:    The  credits  for  each  course  that  counts  toward  the  degree requirement and for which a passing grade is obtained.

Quality Hours:  The credits for each course that is included in the GPA calculation. Quality hours are assigned even when a grade of F is obtained in a course. Failed courses that are used in the determination of the GPA are assigned zero quality hours.

Quality Points:  The numerical value assigned to the relevant letter grade earned. Grade Points: Grade points are determined by multiplying the quality hours by the quality points for a course.

Weighted GPA:  Weighted GPA average is determined by applying appropriate weights for Levels l, ll, and III courses to the grade points and the quality hours used in determining grade point average.

## APPENDIX II :  FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

Students exempted from the above regulation are Liberal  Studies  majors  &amp;  those  pursuing  double  majors  within  the  Faculty  of  Humanities  &amp; Education.

## Q:  CAN I DO CO-CURRICULAR CREDITS?

- A:  Yes. Co-curricular courses are offered through Office of Students Services and Development. Co-curricular  credits  are  done  at  Level  II  and  students  can  get  only  3  credits  of  co-  curricular courses.

## Q. WHAT IS A CREDIT CHECK?

- A. This is a consultation requested at the Faculty Office via telephone, email or in person; which tells the students how far along they are in their degree programme.

## Q.   HOW SOON AFTER THE REQUEST IS MADE CAN I COME IN FOR THE CREDIT CHECK?

- A: . No sooner than one day and no later than two weeks, after which, a new request must be made.

## Q.  CAN I RECEIVE A CREDIT CHECK OVER THE PHONE OR VIA EMAIL?

- A. No, it is a face-to-face interactive consultation with a representative of the Faculty Office. The student will thus be required to take with them their UWI identification card as proof of identity.

## Q:  I ENTERED THE UNIVERSITY BEFORE 2003, WOULD MY DEGREE BE ASSESSED UNDER THE GPA SYSTEM?

- A. All active student records have recently been converted to the Banner GPA system. However, while pre-GPA students are currently being assessed based on the year they matriculated; they are also  being  assessed  under  the  GPA  system.  Whichever  system  is  more  advantageous  to  the student in his/her graduating year, he/she would be awarded the 'better' class of degree.

## Q.   I MISSED AN EXAM. WHAT SHOULD I DO?

- A.  If  you  missed  an  examination  for  medical  reasons,  you  should  submit  a  signed  medical certificate to the UWI Health Centre within seven days. The Health Centre will then submit a letter on your behalf to the Examination Section of the Registry. You may be permitted to sit the exam at the next available sitting. (Refer to Examination Regulations, Section II, 17-32).

If you were absent from an examination for reasons other than medical, you would be required to register  again  for  the  course,  if  said  course  is  compulsory.  Departments  may  however  advise students on other available options (e.g. Exams only).

## Q. WHERE CAN I APPLY FOR A GO-THROUGH OR A REMARK FOR A COURSE I HAVE FAILED?

- A. A request for a go-through or remark can be made at the Examinations Sections.

## Q.   HOW DO I APPLY TO DO A COURSE AS 'EXAMS ONLY'?

- A.   Students are entitled to register for 'exams only' only with the permission of the lecturer for the particular course once the student has registered, attended classes and has completed all course work.  Recommendation for 'exams only' is made by the department in which the course is offered via a letter through the Dean of Faculty to the Student's Records Unit.

## Q. THERE IS A 'WARNING' STATUS ON MY ON-LINE STUDENT RECORD. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

- A.   A 'warning' status reflects poor academic performance (i.e. the receipt of a term GPA of 1.99 or less). This should be taken seriously and the student should seek counsel from his/her academic advisor.  If  such  poor  performance  is  maintained  by  a  student  for  the  following  semester,  the student will be asked to withdraw from the UWI.
- Q.   I WAS ASKED TO WITHDRAW AS A RESULT OF UNSATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE, HOW SOON WILL I BE ALLOWED TO RESUME MY STUDIES?
- A.   No sooner than one (1) year after the date of withdrawal. A student who has been required to withdraw may request a meeting with the Dean, who may decide to waive the requirement.
