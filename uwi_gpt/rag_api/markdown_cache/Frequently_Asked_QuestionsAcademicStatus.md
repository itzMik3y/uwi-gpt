## What are the steps involved in transferring to another Faculty?

- ● Download and complete the application for transfer form which may be accessed via the forms and document page on the Faculty's website.
- ● Sign and submit form to the Admissions Section of the Registry between February and March.

## How do I go about changing from part-time to full-time?

Students who wish to change their enrolment status should first go to the Request a Change of Major or Enrolment Status link at the Student Administrative Systems (SAS) Registration Menu which can be accessed at http://www.mona.uwi.edu.   Students should then notify the Dean's nominee in the Faculty Office who will consider the request for online approval.

Please note that students who were accepted into the Faculty with lower level matriculation must first complete a minimum of 24 credits and two academic years before being eligible for transfer to full-time.

## Where should I go to request a status letter?

Requests for status letters should be made through the Student Administrative Services Section (SASS) of the Registry.

## If the same course is required by both my major and minor, what should I do?

You will not normally be credited for the same course twice.  Please seek guidance from your department regarding a replacement course.

## Is it true that first year courses will not affect my GPA?

The grades earned for your Level 1 courses are not used to calculate the GPA to determine your class of degree, however, these grades will impact your rate of progress and will appear on your transcript.

## What is the difference between exemptions with and without credit?

Exemptions ( without credit ) are applied to pre-selected University level one courses for registered students in the Faculty who obtained a grade one (I) through to grade four (IV) in certain CAPE subjects. Exemptions without credit means that credits will not be granted. In these cases students must replace the subjects done at CAPE subjects with courses approved by the Department.

## I am a part-time student however some of my classes are held in morning, why is this so?

The teaching day for all B.Sc. programmes in the Faculty runs from 8am to 9pm.  Primarily, your enrolment status is taken into account when determining the number of courses you are allowed to take

per semester and when calculating your tuition fees.  In some departments, however, level one courses are offered in the day as well as in the evening.

## How do I go about applying for leave of absence?

A student who for good reason wishes to be absent from an academic programme for a semester or more must apply for formal leave of absence via the Automated Student Request System (ASRS) accessed through the Faculty's website http://www.mona.uwi.edu.

Leave of absence may be granted for one semester or for an academic year.  Leave of absence, however, will not be granted for more than two consecutive academic years.

## Is there a deadline by which I should apply for leave of absence?

Applications for leave of absence must be made no later than the first week in October and the second week in February for Semesters 1 and 2, respectively.

## How do I go about requesting a refund of tuition?

Students will be granted a refund of tuition fees for the relevant semester based on the time frame in which applications for leave of absence or withdrawal are made in writing to the Faculty.

Please note that students who have not paid fees and have applied for leave or absence or withdrawal will be required to pay the fees due before they resume their programme of study.  Refer to the current issue of the Undergraduate Financial Information and Registration Guidelines for Policy on Refund of Tuition, Miscellaneous and Residence Fees.
