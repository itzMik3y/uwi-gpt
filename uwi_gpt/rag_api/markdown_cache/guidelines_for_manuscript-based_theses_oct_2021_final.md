## GUIDELINES FOR MANUSCRIPT-BASED THESES

## The University of the West Indies OCTOBER, 2021

## I. BACKGROUND

- 1. Theses submitted for research degrees may either be in a traditional format or in the form of a collection of manuscripts ('Manuscript-Based thesis'), as is permitted in many Universities.
- 2. Although  The  University  of  the  West  Indies  Regulations  for  Graduate Diplomas and Degrees have not explicitly included this format of thesis, the Thesis  Guide  published  by  the  University  has  some  guidelines  for formatting such Manuscript-Based theses.
- 3. The University of the West Indies, since 2008 has allowed submission of a Manuscript-Based  thesis  for  MPhil,  PhD  and  DBA  programmes. Please note  that  Manuscript-Based  thesis  is  NOT  mandatory.  It  is  only  an alternative  option  and  students  can  continue  to  choose  writing  a  full thesis in the traditional format for submission to examination.
- 4. Although there are many potential advantages for such submissions, the existing  guidelines  lacked  clarity  in  many  areas.  The  Board  of  Graduate Studies and Research, during its meeting in October 2019, discussed the shortcomings  of  the  current  guidelines  and  decided  to  temporarily  stop students  being  admitted  for  the  2020/2021  Academic  Year  to  MPhil  and PhD programmes from submission by Manuscript-Based theses until more adequate guidelines are provided.
- 5. It also mandated the Directors to formulate clear guidelines so as to allow admission of students in the future for this format of theses.

## II. REVISED GUIDELINES

Following are the revised set of Guidelines for Manuscript-Based theses (2020):

In  general,  for  any  type  of  thesis,  the  Thesis  Guide  of  The  UWI  mentions  the following:

- 1. The greater portion of the work submitted for examination must have been done subsequent to the initial registration of the student as a candidate for the degree.
- 2. The thesis must form a distinct contribution to the knowledge of the subject and afford evidence of originality shown either by the discovery of new facts  or  by  the  exercise  of  independent  critical  power.  It  must  be  of  a satisfactory academic standard and must be suitable for publication as a thesis of The University of the West Indies.
- 3. The thesis must consist of the candidate's account of their own research.  It may include work done in conjunction with their Supervisor, provided that the candidate clearly states their personal share in the investigation and that their statement is certified by the Supervisor.
- 4. A paper written or published in the joint names of two or more persons, one  of  whom  is  the  candidate,  may  be  included  as  part  of  the  thesis, provided that the role that the candidate played in the work described in the paper, and the contribution of the other authors, are clearly explained. No thesis shall consist wholly of previously published work.
- 5. The candidate must indicate in a preface how far the thesis embodies the result of his/her own research or observation, and in what respect his/her investigations appear to him/her to advance the study of his/her subject.

The above guidelines are applicable for Manuscript-Based theses also.

In addition, the Thesis Guide of The University of the West Indies also provides the format for Manuscript-Based theses (see below).

## III. REQUIREMENTS FOR MANUSCRIPT-BASED THESES

## A. Authorship

- 1. A thesis at The University of the West Indies may consist essentially of a collection of manuscripts of which the student is the author.
- 2. The student must be the primary (or first author) that is, the lead author who has made the most substantial contribution for each of the manuscripts included in the thesis.
- 3. The  authorship  criteria  include  (but  are  not  limited  to):  substantial contribution towards conceptualization of the research, a thorough review of existing literature in the subject, formulating hypotheses, research design and methodology, writing a research protocol, data collection (and analysis where  applicable),  interpretation  of  the  data and  results, providing recommendations etc.
- 4. The student must make an explicit statement in the thesis about the role he/she  played  in  the work  presented  in  each  manuscript,  and  the contribution of the other authors.  This statement should appear in a single section entitled 'Contributions of Authors' as a preface to the thesis.
- 5. The student must also submit signed waivers from any co-authors of all manuscripts - the waiver should include information that the co-authors do not have any objection in using the manuscript as a component of the thesis, they do not have any conflict of interest and that they have not used the manuscript for any other thesis submission. This statement should also vouch for the veracity of the individual contribution of each author.
- 6. A co-author of any component of a Manuscript-Based thesis cannot serve as either Internal or External Examiner for that thesis.
- 7. A manuscript can be used ONLY in one thesis and any co-author cannot use the same manuscript for any other thesis.

## B. Manuscripts

- 1. For MPhil, a minimum of two (2) manuscripts - either both published or one (1) published and one (1) accepted for publication in peer-reviewed journals/ books / collections in the student's field of study
- 2. For PhD, a minimum of three (3) manuscripts - either all published or two (2) published  and  one  (1)  accepted  for  publication  in  peer-reviewed journals/ books / collections in the student's field of study
- 3. For both MPhil and PhD, other than the 'published' papers associated with the  current  research,  only  one  (1)  paper  is  allowed  as  'accepted'  for publication, i.e., not yet published. For submitted manuscripts, the student should provide evidence in the form of acknowledgement from the journal editor
- 4. Manuscripts must be current (i.e., the publication date must fall between the student's registration and submission of thesis for examination); should have stemmed out of the research project undertaken for the programme
- 5. They manuscript must form a cohesive whole and must report on the single research  project  undertaken  by  the  student  for  the  purpose  of  the programme enrolled
- 6. The  thesis  must  be  more  than  a  simple  collection  of  manuscripts.  All components  must  be  integrated  into  a  cohesive  unit  with  a  logical progression from one chapter to another. In order to ensure that the thesis has continuity, connecting texts that logically bridge each manuscript are mandatory
- 7. The manuscripts, and hence the thesis as a whole, must conform to The UWI's Thesis Guide with respect to line spacing, margins, font size, tables, figures, inter  alia ,  and  the  manuscripts  must  be  bound  together  in  the traditional manner to form one physical thesis.
- 8. The thesis must include the following:
- i. Preliminary pages (in accordance with Section 3.1 of Thesis Guide)
- a) Title Page
- b) Thesis Deposit Licence Agreement

- c) Abstract (general abstract no more than 300 words covering the entire thesis and conforming to style of the Faculty)
- d) Acknowledgements (if any)
- e) Dedication (if any)
- f) Table of Contents
- g) Table of Cases (if any)
- h) Table of Statutes (if any)
- i) Table of Constitutional Instruments (if any)
- j) List of Figures/Tables/Illustrations
- k) Glossary (if any)
- l) List of Abbreviations/Acronyms (if any)
- m) Preface (if any) and Contributions of Authors
- ii. General Introduction which places the research in the appropriate literature  context,  provides  the  rationale  and  objectives  of  the research, and thereby demonstrates the linkages between manuscripts/chapters
- iii. An overall Review of Literature as a separate Chapter
- iv. The individual  manuscripts/chapters (each with its own Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion)
- v. The connecting statements between manuscripts/chapters
- vi. An  overall  comprehensive  Synthesis  /Discussion  section  clearly highlighting the contribution made
- vii. An  overall  list  of  references  (Bibliography  /  References  /  Works cited/Works consulted, conforming to the style of the Faculty/Discipline)
- viii. Appendices
- 9. The thesis must also have a Display Page (showing the Chapter number and  title,  in  bold  capital  letters,  centred  at  the  top  of  the  page)  at  the beginning of each Chapter. This is to be paginated and included in the Table of Contents. On the Display Page, the candidate should include notes about previous or forthcoming publications of the particular Chapter.
- 10. The headings for the references at the end of Chapters should be formatted as  subheadings  and  the  heading  for  the  overall  list  of  references  [8  (vi) above] should be treated as a major heading starting on a new page.
- 11. When published copyright material is presented  in a thesis,  the  student must obtain signed waivers from the publishers and submit these to the Office of Graduate Studies &amp; Research at the time of thesis submission.

- 12. For all manuscripts, the candidate must submit signed waivers from all coauthors.
- 13. The 'Turnitin' report may exclude the proportion of the 'published' material from the overall percentage and can be certified by the Supervisor and/or the Head of the Department
- 14. Since manuscripts may be very concise with limited word-count, the overall synthesis/ discussion/ summary [8 (vi)] above must have sufficient detail regarding  the  importance  and  originality  of  the  research  and  its  clear contribution to the field of study
- 15. It is well-known  that  different  journals  may  have  different  style  of presentation and references. Hence, it is advisable to have the Bibliography/ References [8 (vii)] above as a general chapter with alphabetically arranged references, which will include all the references cited in the whole thesis (including  those  cited  in  the  manuscripts  as  well  as  those  which  were outside of the manuscripts)

## C. Requirements for Manuscripts &amp; Publications
