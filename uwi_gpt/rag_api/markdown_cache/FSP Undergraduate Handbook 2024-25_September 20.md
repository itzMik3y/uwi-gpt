## 2018/19:

-  The BSc and MSc in Sport Sciences at Cave Hill were officially approved for transfer.
-  Two new programmes BSc Sport Coaching and BSc Sport Kinetics were approved for delivery at Mona.

## MESSAGE FROM THE DEAN

<!-- image -->

We welcome all our new and returning students to the new  academic  year.  Last  year  we  celebrated  our  first graduates from our Sport Kinetics programme out of the St. Augustine Campus. This year we will graduate the first from the Global campus! Our Sport Sciences programme at the Cave Hill campus remains robust and we commenced the BSc Sport Coaching programme there as well.  We  are  also  happy  to  report  that  many  of  the graduates have moved on to enroll in our postgraduate programmes at the Master's level.

Our facilities continue to get facelifts on all campuses. As our student bodies enjoy their use, we strive to provide facilities of the highest quality to all our competing teams and our tracks, cricket fields, swimming pool and indoor facilities across the campuses are some of the best in the region.  This  year  we  hope  to  get  the  other  fields  to match.  Our cricket fields at Cave Hill and St. Augustine

## UNDERGRADUATE REGULATIONS &amp; SYLLABUSES 2024 / 2025 THE FACULTY OF SPORT

were used as practice venues for the T20 World Cup and the latter saw the return of First Class cricket in over a decade.

The  newly  branded  Global  Campus  has  allowed  us  to extend our offerings beyond the region. As we welcome the existing students from the former Open Campus, we welcome the new students with the hope that you can settle into your new phase of life seamlessly and suggest that you reach out to senior students and staff as soon as possible if you encounter any difficulties.

Welcome to the Faculty of Sport - your place to shine! We hope you have success academically and in whichever sport you compete in at whatever level. We are here to see you through to your best potential.

Dr. Akshai Mansingh

## UNDERGRADUATE REGULATIONS &amp; SYLLABUSES 2024 / 2025 THE FACULTY OF SPORT

## FACULTY REGULATIONS FOR THE DEGREE OF BACHELOR OF SCIENCE

## Glossary of terms used in these Regulations:

Anti-requisites refer to courses where content overlap precludes courses being taken together for credit.

Assessment Regulations refer to the University's Assessment Regulations for First Degrees, Associate Degrees, Undergraduate Diplomas and Certificates including GPA and Plagiarism Regulations, 2020.

Core or compulsory courses are courses that students must complete in order to be awarded a degree.

Co-requisite is a course which must be taken along with another specified course, in order to ensure the attainment of complementary and/or interdependent competencies.

Courses are offered by a Faculty of the University for credit towards a degree, except Foundation courses.

In-Faculty - All Faculty courses originating in the Faculty of Sport.

Out-of-Faculty - All Faculty courses originating in Faculties other than the Faculty of Sport

Course  substitution refers  to  cases  where  a  course  is  used  to replace  a  compulsory  or  core  course  in  a  student's  programme requirements. Students must seek and obtain approval of replacement courses.

Credit refers  to  a  unit  of  study  counting  towards  a  degree  or diploma.  Undergraduate  courses  in  the  Faculty  normally  carry  a weighting of three (3) credits.  A number of courses, however, carry a weighting of six (6) credits.

Electives refer to a course within a programme taken by choice of the student. This may be:

## UNDERGRADUATE REGULATIONS &amp; SYLLABUSES 2024 / 2025 THE FACULTY OF SPORT

Restricted elective from a subset of courses offered by a department or the Faculty as part of a particular programme

Free elective from any department provided it is at the correct level.

Exemption with credit refers to cases where a student is granted exemption  from  UWI  courses  because  the  student  has  already passed courses in other programmes at the UWI or passed courses of similar content at other recognized institutions.  Students are not required to take replacement courses.

Exemption  without  credit refers  to  cases  where  a  student  is granted  exemption  from  UWI  courses  because  the  student  has already passed equivalent courses at other recognized institutions or  from  other  examination  bodies.    Students  granted Exemption without Credit are required to take replacement courses.

LeveI represents  the  different  standard  of  courses  that  must  be completed in the undergraduate degree programme. Each level, namely  level  I,  level  II,  and  level  III,  is  designated  by  the  first numeral in the course code.  Levels II and III courses are equally weighted for the assessment of class of degree.

Major is a minimum  of 30 credits (variable according to specialization)  from  prescribed  courses  from  levels  II  and  III (advanced courses).

Minor is  a  minimum of 15 credits from prescribed courses from levels II and III (advanced courses).

Practicum refers to a practical section of a Course.

Pre-requisites are courses  which  must  be  completed  before registration for another course is permitted.

Programme is a selection of courses (designed to achieve pedagogical  goals),  the  taking  of  which  is  governed  by  certain regulations and the satisfactory completion of which (determined by such regulations), makes a candidate eligible for the award of a degree/diploma/certificate.

## UNDERGRADUATE REGULATIONS &amp; SYLLABUSES 2024 / 2025 THE FACULTY OF SPORT

## UNIVERSITY REGULATIONS ON PLAGIARISM 4

## Application of these Regulations

- 1. These Regulations apply to the presentation of work by a student for  evaluation,  whether  or  not  for  credit,  but  do  not  apply  to invigilated written examinations.

## Definition of plagiarism

- 2. In these Regulations, 'plagiarism' means the unacknowledged and unjustified use of the words, ideas or creations of another, and  includes  situations  where  the  student  reuses  without acknowledgement  their  own  previously  written  text,  ideas  or creations when writing any new work.

'Level 1 plagiarism' occurs where small quantities of the work are affected and/or the breaches are minor. It includes borderline situations, cosmetic or poor paraphrasing, negligent referencing or incorrect or missing citations.

'Level 2 plagiarism' occurs where large quantities of the work are affected and/or  the  breaches  are  serious.  It includes situations in which a significant amount of material is borrowed or directly quoted or cosmetically paraphrased with no attribution at all, or attribution insufficient to indicate that the borrowed material is not the work of the student.

- 3. What may otherwise meet the definition of plagiarism may be justified for the purposes of Regulation 2 where the particular unacknowledged  use  of  the  words,  ideas  and  creations  of another is by the standards of the relevant academic discipline a function of part or all of the object of the work for evaluation whether or not for credit, for example:
- a. The  unacknowledged use is  required  for  conformity  with presentation standards;
- b. The task set or undertaken is one of translation of the work of another into a different language or format;
- c. The task set or undertaken requires producing a result by teamwork  for  joint credit regardless of the level of individual contribution;

## UNDERGRADUATE REGULATIONS &amp; SYLLABUSES 2024 / 2025 THE FACULTY OF SPORT

- d. The task set or undertaken requires extensive adaptation of models within a time period of such brevity as to exclude extensive attribution;
- e. The task set or undertaken requires the use of an artificial language, such as is the case with computer programming, where the use of unoriginal verbal formulae is essential.
- 4. It is not  a  justification  under  Regulations  2  and  3  for  the unacknowledged  use  of  the  words,  ideas  and  creations  of another that  the  user  enjoys  the  right  of  use  of  those  words, ideas and creations as a matter of intellectual property.

## Other definitions

- 5. In these Regulations,
- 'Chair' means the Chair of the relevant Campus Committee on Examinations;

'Examination  Regulations' means  the  Examination  and  other forms  of  Assessment  Regulations  for  First  Degrees  Associate Degrees Diplomas and Certificates of the University; 'set of facts' means a fact or combination of facts.

## Evidence of plagiarism

- 6. In order  to  constitute  evidence  of  plagiarism  under  these Regulations, there must be identified as a minimum the passage or passages in the student's work which are considered to have been plagiarised and the passage or passages from which the passages  in  the  student's  work  are  considered  to  have  been derived.

## Student certification

- 7. When a student submits for examination work under Regulation 1, the student shall sign a statement, in such form as the Campus Registrar  may  prescribe,  that  as  far  as  possible  the  work submitted is free of plagiarism including unattributed quotation or  paraphrase  of  the  work  of  another  except  where  justified under Regulation 3.
- 8. Quotation  or  paraphrase  is  attributed  for  the purpose  of Regulation 7 if the writer has indicated that the work is not the writer's own, even if the source is not identified.

## UNDERGRADUATE REGULATIONS &amp; SYLLABUSES 2024 / 2025 THE FACULTY OF SPORT

- 9. Accurate certification under Regulation 7 is not conclusive as to the absence of plagiarism under these Regulations. Absence of certification  does  not  prohibit  the  University  from  proceeding with a charge of plagiarism.

## Electronic vetting for plagiarism

- 10. The Campus Registrar may authorise or direct with the consent of  the  student  that  work  submitted  under  Regulation  7  be subjected  to  electronic  scrutiny  in  order  to  verify  its  freedom from plagiarism before being submitted to the Examiners. The results of the electronic scrutiny shall be submitted to the Dean and the Head of Department as well as to the Examiners, but the results of such electronic scrutiny although capable, where the requirements  of  Regulation  6  are  satisfied,  of  constituting evidence under these Regulations, are not thereby conclusive of any question as to whether or not plagiarism exists.
- 11. Where  a  Dean  or  Head  of  Department  considers  that  the procedure under Regulation 10 discloses evidence of plagiarism, the Dean or Head of Department, as the case may be, shall:
- (a) where the procedure is considered to disclose evidence of Level  2  plagiarism,  report  the  matter  to  the  Campus Registrar under Regulation 15(a); or
- (b) where the procedure is considered to disclose evidence of Level  1  plagiarism,  refer  the  matter  to  the  Examiners  for their consideration as a charge of Level 1 plagiarism under Regulation 12.

## Level 1 plagiarism

- 12. In work submitted for examination where the Examiner is satisfied that Level 1 plagiarism has been committed, he shall levy a penalty for the Level 1 plagiarism charged in the form of a reduction in the marks up to a maximum of 10%.

## Level 2 plagiarism

- 13. Where an examiner has evidence of Level 2 plagiarism in the material  being  examined,  that  examiner  must  report  it  to  the

## UNDERGRADUATE REGULATIONS &amp; SYLLABUSES 2024 / 2025 THE FACULTY OF SPORT

Head of Department or the Dean and may at any time provide the Registrar with a copy of that report.

- 14. Where any other person who in the course of duty sees material being  examined  that  has  evidence  of  Level  2  plagiarism  that other person may report it to the Head of Department or the Dean and may at any time report it to the Campus Registrar who shall take such action as may be appropriate.
- 15.   Where a Dean or Head of Department receives a report either under Regulation 13, the Dean or Head of Department, as the case may be, shall:
- a. where  in  concurrence  with  the  report's  identification  of evidence  of  Level  2  plagiarism,  report  the  matter  to  the Campus Registrar; or
- b. where not concurring in the identification of evidence of plagiarism,  reply  to  the  Examiner  declining  to  proceed further on the Examiner's report; or
- c. where  concluding that there is evidence of Level 1 plagiarism, reply to the Examiner indicating that conclusion and proceed as under Regulation 12.
- 16. Where  a  report  is made  to  the  Campus  Registrar  under Regulation 15a or Regulation 17, the Campus Registrar shall lay a  charge  and  refer  the  matter  to  the  Campus  Committee  on Examinations.
- 17. Where  the  Campus  Registrar receives a report from  the Examiner or any other person, the Campus Registrar shall refer the  matter  to  a  senior  academic  to  determine  evidence  to ground a charge of plagiarism and where there is a ground, the Campus Registrar shall proceed as under Regulation 16.
- 18. Where the matter has been referred to the Campus Committee on  Examinations  pursuant  to  Regulation  16,  the  proceedings under these Regulations prevail, subject to Regulation 19, over any other disciplinary proceedings against the student based on the  same  facts  and,  without  prejudice  to  Regulation  24,  any other such disciplinary proceedings must be stayed, subject to being reopened.

## UNDERGRADUATE REGULATIONS &amp; SYLLABUSES 2024 / 2025 THE FACULTY OF SPORT

- 19.   Where other disciplinary proceedings based on the same facts have been completed or have reached the stage of a hearing, whichever comes first, any proceedings under these Regulations based on a charge of Level 2 plagiarism shall be terminated.

20.

- (a) If  the  Campus  Committee  on  Examinations  is  satisfied,  after holding  a  hearing,  that  the  student  has  committed  Level  2 plagiarism, it shall in making a determination on the severity of the penalty take into consideration:
- i. the circumstances of the particular case;
- ii. the seniority of the student; and
- iii. whether this is the first or a repeated incidence of Level 2 plagiarism.
- (b) Where  a  recommendation  is  made  to  fail  the  student,  the Campus Committee on Examinations shall make that recommendation to the Campus Registrar who shall refer it to the Academic Board for the student to be failed.
- 21. Academic  Board  may  also, if the Campus  Committee  on Examinations  so  recommends  after  being  satisfied  that  the student has committed Level 2 plagiarism, exclude the student from all further examinations of the University for such period as it may determine.
- 22. Academic  Board  may  also, if the Campus  Committee  on Examinations  so  recommends  after  being  satisfied  that  the student has committed Level 2 plagiarism, dismiss the candidate from the University.

## Clearance on a charge of Level 2 plagiarism

- 23. A determination of the Campus Committee on Examinations that Level 2 plagiarism has not been found will be reported to the Campus Registrar who shall refer it to the appropriate authority and notify the student.   Where the Committee has not identified Level  2  but  has  identified  Level  1,  it  shall  be  reported  to  the Campus Registrar who shall refer it to the Examiner.

The 2024-2025 academic year was quite successful which saw the  refurbishment  of  the  sporting  facilities,  an  increase  in facilities rentals and sustained numbers in the undergraduate academic programmes. The Usain Bolt Sport Complex became the unofficial temporary home of track and field in Barbados and we remain committed to maintaining a strong relationship with the Athletic Association of Barbados (AAB). Our relationships with the national and regional sporting organizations  thrive  as  we  aid  in  the  development  of  our athletes and sport.

Some  of  our  graduates  and  students  continue  to  strive  for excellence  in  reaching  the  pinnacle  of  their  sporting  and professional  careers.  Mr.  Kavem  Hodge  was  selected  to  the West  Indies  Cricket  Team,  Ms.    Llori  Sharpe  received  a professional cycling contract with a European  club,  Mr. Damique Walters was hired as the Strength and Conditioning Coach for the Windward Islands Cricket Team, former cricketer with the Combined Campuses and Colleges (CCC), Mr. Miles Bascombe,  was  appointed  as  the  Cricket  West  Indies  (CWI)

## UNDERGRADUATE REGULATIONS &amp; SYLLABUSES 2024 / 2025 THE FACULTY OF SPORT

Director of Cricket,  Ms.  Faye Agard, Ms. Teresa Howell,  Ms. Akeena Stoute and Ms. Brianna Holder were selected to play for the Barbados  National  Netball  Team  at  the  Central American and Caribbean Games (CAC) and the Netball World Cup, and twenty-one (21) current and former Blackbirds (13 women and 8 men) were selected for the Barbados National Hockey  Teams  to  the  (CAC)  Games.  These  achievements highlight  the  strength  of  both  the  academic  and  sporting programmes.

Our commitment to excellence remain steadfast, both on and off  the  field  of  play.  We  anticipate  the  2024-2025  academic year will realize greater successes with an increase in student enrollment and loftier accomplishments in our sporting disciplines.  As  an  academic  and  sporting  institution,  we  are resolute in our dedication to the development of our students, athletes, sport and the national and regional sporting organizations.

The  Academy  of  Sport  at  Cave  Hill  Campus  welcome  the incoming Blackbirds for the 2024-2025 academic year and we look forward to their contributions and dedication in upholding our motto of 'One Flies, All Soar.'

## THE FACULTY OF SPORT

## STUDENT EXCHANGE &amp; STUDY ABROAD

INTERNATIONAL OFFICE - OFFICE OF INSTITUTIONAL ADVANCEMENT AND INTERNATIONALISATION (OIAI)

The St. Augustine Campus has a range of partnership agreements managed through the International Office, OIAI that facilitates exchanges by UWI students as well as students from our international partners to spend time at each other's campuses.  The Office also enables student mobility with institutions where we do not have such formal partnerships.

The UWI Student Exchange programme will allow you to study at one of our many international partners around the world, including in North America, Europe, South America, Africa, Asia and the Caribbean in addition to other UWI Campuses.

This type of international immersion has many educational and personal benefits. Students who have participated in the past have all spoken about the tremendous experiences and learnings not only in the classroom, but also from the people and places that they were able to interact with. They have become more independent in their thinking, self-sufficient and confident. They have also been able to make new friends, learn new languages and experience the world first-hand as true global citizens.  A number of options for student exchanges are available to undergraduate and postgraduate students which are:

- 1. Exchange Students - one semester to one year duration.
- 2. Study tours through the 'UWI Discover's' programme for one to two weeks.
- 3. Visiting Students - for postgraduate students doing research on invitation by overseas institution.

Funding is available to assist students with some of these exchange opportunities.

For further information on funding as well as Student Exchange and Student Mobility, please view our website:

## CERTIFICATE IN THE ART AND SCIENCE OF COACHING COURSES

## EDSP 0001 - HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF EXERCISE

It  is  essential  that  coaching  personnel, in any form of athletics and games  needing  the  use  of  the  body,  should  be  more  than  merely acquainted with the human body and the relationship of its parts to the total working of the healthy person. This knowledge is critical for healthy  living  and  even,  more  so,  for  rigorous  work  and  play. Students, thus, must be knowledgeable about the range and types of movement that the skeleton-muscular system can make, in order to train/educate the body, without subjecting it to unnecessary distress or injury.

## EDSP 0101 - DIET AND PERFORMANCE

A  continuous  supply  of  energy  is  vital  for  sports  performance. Coaches need to understand the impact that diet has on performance in both training and competition. It is essential, therefore, that they understand  the  relationship  between  nutrient  intake  and  storage, energy metabolism and exercise performance.

## THE FACULTY OF SPORT

## EDSP 0201 - ISSUES AND VALUES IN SPORT AND PHYSICAL EDUCATION

Coaches  do  not  operate  in  a  sporting  vacuum.  It  is  important, therefore, that they understand the social cultural, political, religious and economic contexts within which they will work. It is essential that they understand what sport is and what it means to its participants. Sports must be examined in a multi-disciplinary way to illustrate the complex issues of modern-day sport.

## EDSP 0202 - SPORT INJURIES: PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT

## EDSP 0002 - MEASUREMENT AND EVALUATION IN HUMAN PERFORMANCE

In  sport,  planning  of  each  athlete's  training  is  crucial  in  order  to achieve  optimum  success.    This  planning  has  become  much  of  a science over the last few decades.  As a result of this planning, we have witnessed huge improvements in human performance.  A major part of such planning of training is measurement and evaluation of athletic performance.  This course seeks to provide the student with the  tools  necessary  to  create  and  implement  an  effective  training programme to ensure success of athletes.

## EDSP 0401 - OBSERVATION AND ANALYSIS OF HUMAN PERFORMANCE

It is essential that coaches  are able to observe  and  analyse performance if they are to help their athletes to improve. This also requires  the  ability  to  provide  corrective  feedback  so  that  the necessary changes may be brought about.

## EDSP 0502 - PRACTICUM:  WORKING WITH ATHLETES

This  course  draws  upon  the  previous  coaching  experiences  of  the student as a basis for further work in a specific coaching environment. Students will be brought into contact with a wide range of athletes in terms of ability, personality, motivation and other relevant social and

## Appendix II:  Presenting and Documenting Material in Course Essays

Students often run into trouble when presenting and documenting material  in  course  essays.  The  following  guidelines  should  help students to steer clear of any of the pitfalls that might result in being penalised  for  breaching  academic  standards.  Remember,  it  is  your responsibility to ensure that your essays adhere to the standards of academic integrity.

## Types of Borrowed Material

There are three basic ways in which students may incorporate the ideas that they have confronted in their reading in their essays: quotation, summary and paraphrase. Far too many students misunderstand the differences between these.

## Quotation

With a quotation, you present another writer's idea in that writer's words. You must indicate the borrowing with either quotation marks or block indentation, combined with a footnote/endnote reference. For example:

According to Stigler, 'every industry or occupation that has enough political power to utilize the state will seek to control entry. In addition, the regulatory policy will often be so fashioned as to retard the rate of growth of new firms.' 1

## Summary

A summary is where you present another writer's idea, only not his or her words; further, you present only the core of the idea-the main point-because you condense the idea as you reword it. You must also indicate the borrowing with a footnote/endnote, usually combined with an introduction (called a frame) that also attributes the summary.  Here is a summary of the sample quotation:

Stigler argues that influential economic interests seek regulations that reduce competition. 1

## Paraphrase

A  paraphrase  is  like  a  summary  in  that  you  present  only  another writer's  idea,  not  his  exact  words;  this  time,  however,  instead  of compressing the idea, you restate it in your own words.  Thus, the paraphrase is a little like a translation. Although it isn't usually a word-

## UNDERGRADUATE REGULATIONS &amp; SYLLABUSES 2024 / 2025 THE FACULTY OF SPORT

for-word  substitution,  it  often  follows  the  pattern  of  the  original wording.  Again you must indicate the borrowing with a footnote or endnote, usually combined with an introduction that also attributes the paraphrase. Here is a paraphrase of the sample quotation from Stigler:

Stigler says that economic interests with sufficient influence over government  policy  will  try  to  bring  about  public  policies  that deter  competition  from  other  firms.  They  will  also  encourage rules and regulations that are detrimental to new rivals. 1

All  three  types  of  presentation  use  borrowed  ideas,  but  only  a quotation uses borrowed words.  You can mix another writer's words into  your  summary or paraphrase, but you must show the specific borrowing in quotation marks . Here is our example summary with a touch of quotation thrown in :

Stigler says that the economic interests with sufficient 'power to utilize the state' will seek regulation that operates to reduce the threat of competition from potential rivals. 1

## Framing Your Presentation

Whether you quote, summarise, or paraphrase, you must give due attribution  to  your  source,  by  framing  the  borrowed  idea  with  an introduction and a footnote/endnote. Your endnote must include a specific reference to the text from which you borrowed the material including  page  numbers.    Keep  in  mind  that,  in  the  absence  of  a quotation, the reference in a footnote or endnote refers only to the single sentence that the notation follows. Of course, quotation marks or  block  indentations  indicate  the  length  of  a  quotation.    But summaries  and  paraphrases  don't  have  such  ready  mechanical indicators.    However,  you  can  frame  a  borrowing  (especially  a summary or paraphrase) with an introduction and a footnote.   An introduction like 'Stigler argues' or 'According to Christopher Hood, Stigler  argues'  will  indicate  the  beginning  of  a  borrowing,  and  the footnote/endnote reference will indicate the end. Then the footnote reference applies to the entire borrowing.

## Framing Hints

To  work  borrowed  material  into  your  papers,  you  must  frame  it gracefully  as  well  as  responsibly.    There  are  many  varied  ways  to frame a quotation, paraphrase, or summary.  Here is an example of the most common approach:

## UNDERGRADUATE REGULATIONS &amp; SYLLABUSES 2024 / 2025

## THE FACULTY OF SPORT

According to Stigler, 'every industry or occupation that has enough political  power  to  utilize  the  state  will  seek  to  control  entry.  In addition, the regulatory policy will often be so fashioned as to retard the rate of growth of new firms.' 1

Don't rely solely on this frame, or your writing will seem mechanical and monotonous.  Consider the alternatives below, and also note how the authors of your reading assignments frame their references to others.

## Variations on the 'According to' Frame:

It was Mancur Olson who first pointed out that 'unless the number of individuals is quite small, or unless there is coercion or some other special  device  to  make  individuals  act  in  their  common  interest, rational  self-interested individuals  will not  act  to  achieve  their common or group interests. ' 1

In their article, 'Institutional Perspectives on Political Institutions', March  and Olsen contrast the bargaining or exchange  account  of  politics  with  an  institutional  story  which 'characterizes politics in a more integrative fashion, emphasizing the creation of identities and  institutions as well as their structuring effect on political life.'  1

## The Interrupting Frame:

'Tales of monumental blunders, blatant self-interest and corruption,  self-destructive  organisational  civil  wars  and  feuds, astonishing failures to look ahead or take any initiative in the face of the most pressing problems are,' as Christopher Hood argues in The Art of the State, 'far from unusual in most societies.' 1

## The Separate-Sentence Frame:

'If bureaucrats are ordinary men, they will make most (not all) of their decisions in terms of what benefits them, not society as a whole.'  1  In these terms, Gordon Tullock makes a departure from the  orthodox  assumption  in  public  administration  that  public servants act in the public interest.

## Minor Errors-Format

On one end of the spectrum are minor errors in format.  There are formats in all parts of life: don't eat peas with a knife; don't begin a

## UNDERGRADUATE REGULATIONS &amp; SYLLABUSES 2024 / 2025

## THE FACULTY OF SPORT

bibliography entry with an author's first name.  For those who ignore formats, punishments range from an admonishment to a deduction of a few points from a paper's grade.

## Major Errors-Plagiarism

At the opposite end of the trouble spectrum is plagiarism.  Plagiarism involves  presenting  someone  else's  words  or  ideas  without  giving proper credit. Therefore, you obviously plagiarize (a) if you present someone else's words as though they were your own (by seeming to summarize or paraphrase when in fact you quote directly) or (b) if you present someone else's ideas without giving proper credit (by failing to  document  at  all).    Punishment  depends  on  the  extent  of  the offense. But you should realize this: any plagiarism violates academic integrity, so anything beyond the most minor, accidental plagiarism will  usually  result  in  a  zero  grade  for  a  paper,  with  no  chance  to rewrite.

## Major Errors-Other

On the trouble spectrum between minor errors and plagiarism, there are  other  serious  errors  that  can  bring  severe  punishment.    All  of them  breach  academic  integrity  (making  a  zero  grade  possible)  of them could be evidence of cheating.  As with plagiarism, the extent of the error will determine the extent of the punishment.

## Blanket Notes

Remember  that,  except  with  quotations,  a  footnote  or  endnote generally  covers  only  the  preceding  sentence.    The  old  student standby device of putting a notation at the  end of a paragraph to document something in the paragraph just won't work.  The problem could,  of  course,  simply  be  sloppy  presentation,  or  the  sloppiness could be interpreted as an attempt to disguise cheating.  Avoid the trouble by using the frame of introduction and parenthetical notation to indicate where a borrowing begins and ends.

## Wrongly Attributed Borrowing

You must attribute the material you borrow to the source you actually use.    For  example,  you  find  in  a  book  by  Smith  a  quotation  Smith borrowed  from  another  book  by  Jones.    If  you  use  the  Jones quotation, you must document the borrowing as material from Jones that you found in a book by Smith. You cannot, however, document the passage as if you had found it in the book by Jones or as if Smith

## UNDERGRADUATE REGULATIONS &amp; SYLLABUSES 2024 / 2025 THE FACULTY OF SPORT

himself  had  written  it.    Either  of  these  ways  misattributes  the quotation,  and  you  could  be  accused  of  deceiving  your  reader  by claiming you'd read Jones' book.

## Padded Bibliographies

If you use a simple one-part bibliography, you must list only the works you actually cite in your paper.  You cannot list other works you didn't cite but which you think the reader should be aware of.  Listing works not cited in the paper gives the appearance that you've done more work  than  you  really  have.    So  how  can  you  show  works  that influenced you but that you didn't borrow material from?  Use a twopart bibliography, the first part called 'Works Cited' and the second part called 'Works Consulted.'  Their formats are the same.
