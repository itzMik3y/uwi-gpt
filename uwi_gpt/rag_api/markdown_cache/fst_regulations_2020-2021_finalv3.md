Teaching in the Science Faculty commenced at Mona in 1949 with students in the  Departments  of  Botany,  Chemistry,  Mathematics,  Physics,  and Zoology. The 1960s saw a period of rapid expansion of the Faculty. At St. Augustine  and  Cave  Hill,  teaching  commenced  in  1963  and  1964 respectively  in  the  then  College  of  Arts  and  Sciences  in  Chemistry, Mathematics and Physics. These subjects were incorporated into the Faculty in 1972.

Currently, the Faculty of Science and Technology at Mona offers majors in the  areas  of  Biochemistry,  Biotechnology  Chemistry,  Computer  Science, Geography,  Geology,  Mathematics,  Microbiology,  Life  Sciences  and Physics.    Additionally,  Information  Technology  is  also  offered  at  the Western Jamaica Campus.

The  first  eleven  UWI  graduates  appeared  in  1952 and  by 2000  over 9,000 graduates had been produced. In the 2018/2019 academic year the Faculty undergraduate student population was 2965 at Mona, 2216 at St. Augustine and 949 at Cave Hill. The University was ranked among Times Higher Education's top 1,258 universities in the world for 2020.

Relationships with Tertiary Level Institutions are increasing and students at Colleges in Antigua, The Bahamas and St. Lucia read the Part I courses of our programme; and a number of Community Colleges in Jamaica offer our Preliminary Courses. In addition to undergraduate teaching, postgraduate teaching and research are important aspects of the work of the Faculty.  The Faculty offers a wide range of MSc programmes, and research programmes towards MPhil and PhD degrees in all Departments.

( N.B. Candidates must also satisfy Departmental Requirements.)

## B. OUTLINE OF THE DEGREE PROGRAMME

- 3. The degree of BSc is awarded on the basis of a programme of studies comprising combinations of courses in science disciplines, together with certain Foundation courses. Out-of-Faculty courses may be included.
- 4. The  Science  Faculties † offer  Bachelor  degrees  in  Science *   which  must include  at  least  a  major  in  a  FST  discipline.  A  FST  major  may  be combined  with  another  major or one  or  two  minors,  which  may  be selected from other FST disciplines or from other Faculties.

The degrees offered may therefore comprise:

- (a) A  degree with a single major (minimum 30 credits from Levels 2 and 3) or , with permission of the Faculty and the respective departments, a double major in two FST disciplines or a double major in one FST discipline and an Out-of-Faculty discipline
- (b) A  degree with a single major in a FST discipline PLUS
- (i) one or two minors from other distinct FST disciplines (minimum 15 credits from Levels 2 and 3) or
- (ii) a major or one or two minors  from other Faculties. Out-ofFaculty majors and minors are governed by the regulations of the Faculty of origin.
- (c) Degrees as offered by the Science Faculties and as listed by the respective departments.
- 5. The following types of courses, which may consist of both theoretical and practical parts, are offered by the University:
- (a) Courses  taught  by  the  Science  Faculties  ( in-Faculty  courses ) include  Preliminary  (Level  0)  and  Levels  1,  2  and  3  courses. (Preliminary courses may be used to satisfy entry requirements of Regulation 2 above, but do not contribute towards the requirements for the award of a degree.)
- (b) Service courses , which provide students with basic techniques and skills needed for dealing with the academic programme.
- (c) Out-of-Faculty courses which may contribute toward the requirements for the award of a degree.

- (d) Foundation courses (see Appendix III) which are given throughout the University to augment the general education of students.
- (e) Co-curricular activities approved for credit by Academic Board. A  maximum  of three  credits of  co-curricular  activities  may  be included  as  part  of  the  credits  required  for  the  award  of  a degree, but shall not be taken into account in the determination of the Cumulative GPA or the class of degree.  They may not be substituted for Foundation Courses.  Co-curricular credits gained in excess of three will be entered on the student's transcript but will not contribute toward the requirements for the degree.
- 6. Courses  normally  extend  over  one  semester,  but  in  special  cases  may extend over two semesters. The contact hours for a course are expressed in terms  of  Credit  Hours  (credits)  and  the  credit-rating  of  a  course  is determined by the Faculty which administers the course.  ( See Appendix V ).
- 7. In  order  to  be  eligible  for  award  of  the  Science  Faculties'  degrees, candidates must :
- (a) have been in satisfactory attendance for a period equivalent to at least six semesters of full-time study from entry into Level 1;

and

- 9. (a) Students must register for courses at the beginning of the academic year. Time limits governing changes in registration are as outlined in the student handbooks for each Campus. A student is deemed to be registered  for a  course  only  after  his/her  financial obligations to the University have been fulfilled.
- (b) In  selecting  courses,  including  those  required  for  the  various combinations  of  majors  and  minors,  students  must  ensure  that time-tabling  constraints  do  not  interfere  with  their  ability  to effectively pursue the desired course or programme.
- 10. A  student  who  has  passed  a  course  will  not  be  permitted  to  reregister for that course.
- 11. Registration  for  any  course  (except  audited  courses)  automatically implies entry for the associated examinations.  A student who fails to attend the examinations without having previously withdrawn from the course, or without having tendered evidence of illness at the time of the examinations,  certified  by  a  medical  practitioner  recognized  by  the University, will be  deemed  to  have  failed  the  course.

## E. EXAMINATIONS

- 16. In  order  to  pass  a  course,  a  student  must  have  been  in  satisfactory attendance at the course and must have satisfied the examiners in the associated examinations.
- 17. The  examination  associated  with  each  course  shall  be  conducted  by means of written and/or practical papers, normally taken at the end of the  semester  in  which  the  candidate  has  registered  for  the  courses concerned.  In  addition,  oral  examinations  as  well  as  performance  in course  work  in  the  form  of  essays,  in-course  tests,  research  papers, projects, or continuous assessment of theoretical and/or practical work may also contribute towards the final grade awarded in a course.
- 18. When  practical  papers  and/or  coursework  contribute  towards  the overall final grade for the course , candidates will usually be required to satisfy the examiners in all aspects of the course . On the basis of

performance in the practical component of the course, a candidate may, on  the  recommendation  of  the  Department  concerned,  be  exempted from the practical part of the examination.

- 19. A Part II student who marginally fails a course needed for advancement or  for  graduation,  having  satisfied  the  Departmental  requirements, may, at the discretion of the Faculty Board of Examiners, be offered a Supplementary Oral. Any candidate who satisfies the examiners in a Supplementary Oral will be given the minimum passing grade for the course C (50%)). No more than eight credits may be gained through Supplementary Orals.
- 20. A candidate who fails the examination associated with a course may be given permission to repeat the course and the examination on a subsequent occasion.
- (a) In the event that such a candidate has satisfied the examiners in the coursework, the candidate may, on the recommendation of the relevant Department, be exempted from the coursework passed. If  such  a  recommendation  has  been  made,  the  candidate  may apply to the Dean for permission to take the examination without attending the course (Exam Only).
- (b) A student who fails a course twice will not normally be allowed to  repeat  this  course  again.  Examinations  associated  with  the Summer Programme are counted as repeats.
- 21. The Academic Board of a candidate's Campus, on the recommendation of the Faculty Board concerned, may debar the candidate from writing the  examination  associated  with  a  course if  the  candidate  has  not attended and/or performed satisfactorily in the course . The grade for such a candidate will be recorded as Absent Fail .

## F. GPA  AND CLASS OF DEGREE 

- 22. (a) A Semester grade point average which  includes all approved courses for which the student is registered in a semester, whether passed  or  failed,  will  be  calculated  for  the  determination  of academic standing.
- (b) A Cumulative  grade  point  average which  includes  all  courses completed excluding those taken on a Pass/Fail basis, audited

- courses, Preliminary courses and courses designated I or IP will be calculated and recorded on the student's transcript.
- (c) A Programme/Degree grade point average including all Level 2 and 3 courses, whether passed or failed, will be calculated for determination of the class of the degree. (See Appendix VI for the relationship between marks, grade point average and class of degree) .
- 23. All courses included in the computation of the grade point averages in Regulation 22, are weighted according to the number of credits for the course.

## G. LEAVE OF ABSENCE AND VOLUNTARY WITHDRAWAL

- 24. (a) A student who wishes to be absent from the Faculty for a semester or more may apply for Leave of Absence, through the Dean, to the campus Academic Board, stating the reasons for the application.
- (b) Leave  of  Absence  will  not  be  granted  for  more  than two consecutive semesters in the first instance. However, students may apply for an extension of leave.
- (c) Leave  of  Absence  will  not  be  granted  for  more  than four consecutive semesters.
- (d) Applications  for  Leave  of  Absence  or  extension  thereof  should normally be submitted by the end of the registration period in the relevant semester.
