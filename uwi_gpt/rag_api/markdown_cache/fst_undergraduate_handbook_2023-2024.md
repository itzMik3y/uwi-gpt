## DISCLAIMER

This Undergraduate  Handbook  has  been  compiled  to  improve  the communication between staff and students regarding programmes, that is, the majors, minors and options offered within the Faculty. The programme requirements outlined are to be adhered to by 1) Students enrolling in the Faculty for the 2023-2024 academic year; 2) Students who transferred into the Faculty for the 2023-2024 academic year; and 3) Students who changed their major/minor for the 2023-2024 academic year.

Though  the  Faculty  worked  assiduously  to  present  the  most  updated information  in  the  Handbook,  students  should  communicate  with  their Departments/Sections for changes that possibly occurred after the publication of the Handbook.

## Pre-Trained Teachers:

An important feature of this programme is the field-work component that is carried out in local secondary schools. The field-work enables pre-trained teachers to get initial  teaching  experience  by  first  working  in  pairs  in  their  second  year  for  6

weeks, and then individually, during their final year, for 10 weeks.  For the fieldwork components, teachers in training are required to plan and deliver aspects of the secondary school science curricula under joint supervision of UWI personnel and the  cooperating  teachers  in  the  schools  assigned.  During  the  two  years  in  the advanced part of the programme, effort is made to expose students to teaching at both the lower and upper levels in more than one type of secondary schools. In final year, students are required to plan, implement and evaluate a specific lesson that they have taught while on field-work.

## Trained Teachers:

Trained teachers take the same advanced chemistry courses pursued by the pretrained  teachers.  The  trained  teachers  get  an  opportunity  to  revisit  teaching through their field-work experience. They are required to use action research as a means of planning, implementing and evaluating specific interventions  that  are used to teach topics from the CSEC curriculum. Strong emphasis is also placed on reflective  practice  and  on  identifying  areas  of  their  teaching  that  need  to  be strengthened. The field-work places strong focus on professional development and is carried out over a 6-week period in selected secondary schools.

N.B.  Candidates  who  have  completed  the  New  Double  Option  Science  diploma programmes from  The  MICO  University  College  or  Church  Teachers  College (with a GPA ≥ 2.5) may be exempt from Level 1 Chemistry courses.

## COMP3911

## INTERNSHIP IN COMPUTING I

(3 Credits) (Level 3) (Semester 1, 2 and Summer Term)

## Pre-requisite:

Permission of the Head of Department.

## Course Content:

The exact nature of the internship depends upon the interests of the student and the specific needs of the cooperating organisation. It is assumed and expected that the intern will be involved in some area of computing and thereby gain valuable experience in his/her selected field of study.

Internships  contribute  to  the  education of  the  whole  person  by  emphasizing  the importance  of  work  and  by  providing  opportunities  for  self-reflection.  The internship should be chosen to build on the student's own interests and to relate

what he/she has learned in school to its application in the workplace. In addition, the internship should help the student evaluate him/herself as a worker and as a potential employee in a particular professional field. Through the internship, the student will enhance his/her feelings of self-worth and confidence in performing in the workplace. While on the job, the student should not only apply lessons learned in school to his/her particular job tasks, but he/she should also explore vocational possibilities and seek to discover what kinds of work he/she enjoys. In addition, the student  will  be  able  to  build  on  his/her  résumé  and  professional  portfolio. Internship experiences should also offer the student access to potential mentors in his/her professional field.

## Responsibility of the Student:

The student is required to spend about l50 working hours (e.g. 12 hours per week for approximately 13 weeks during semester 1 or 2, or 40 hours per week for approximately  4  weeks)  working  on  a  project  or  projects  of  the  participating organisation's choice. Where the students are registered for the course in semester 1 or 2, the hours allotted for the internship exercise should be selected by the student, at times when no classes are scheduled.

## The student must:

- · meet regularly with the Departmental Internship Coordinator (IC) and periodically with fellow interns to discuss his/her internship experiences
- · maintain a journal indicating dates and hours worked, and a brief description of the work performed
- · submit a final report summarising and evaluating the internship experience; and
- · complete a résumé and interview at the Office of Placement and Career Services, UWI (Mona)

Any problems encountered during the internship should be discussed immediately with the IC so that appropriate action can be taken.

## Responsibility of the participating Organisation:

Participating organisations will be vetted by the Internship Coordinator to ensure that they are suitable.

## The organisation will:

- · provide a mentor and appropriate work environment
- · expose the student to the type of work which he/she would encounter in an entry level professional position
- · provide appropriate personnel to oversee the project(s) assigned to the student, and the resources needed to accomplish the work
- · treat the student as it would any employee, and
- · expect the same degree of responsibility from the student, even as the student is not an employee of the firm

## The mentor will be asked to:

- · provide a written evaluatio n of the student's performance to the IC at the end of the internship;
- · provide the student with a periodic evaluation of his/her performance; and
- · consult with the IC when and if necessary.

Although an internship is a learning experience, it is expected that the student will normally  earn  some  compensation  for  work  performed  that  may  contribute  to income generating activities, either in the form of a wage,  stipend, or reimbursement of expenses.

## Responsibility of the Internship Coordinator (IC):

## The IC will:

- · organise preparation seminars for students at the start of each semester., featuring  presentations  from  the  Office  of  Placement  and  Career Services, industry personnel and alumni
- · arrange preliminary meetings with mentors where students are briefed on expectations and responsibilities specific to the organisation;
- · meet/correspond  with  students:  student  group  meetings  (weekly)  via online journal, videoconference, etc.  for students to share experiences;
- · review reports from the organisation;
- · review reports from the student;
- · serve as a liaison between the Department of Computing (DoC) and the participating organisation;
- · oversee the progress of the intern;
- · make suggestions to both the student and the organisation on ways to enhance the benefits of the internship;
- · meet regularly with the intern to discuss his/her experiences
- · help resolve any problems the organisation and the student might have; and
- · review all the reports submitted by the participating organisation and the student.

## Evaluation:

There will be two components of the course's assessment: the internship mentor's evaluation and the student's work during the internship and his/her final su bmission at the conclusion of the internship. Students must pass both aspects of the course.

The internship mentor will provide a written evaluation of the student's performance.  This  assessment  will  be  done  using  a  5-point  Likert  scale . An assessment/evaluation form will be provided for this purpose, and the form will be returned to the DoC in a sealed envelope. The internship coordinator will assign a grade not exceeding 25% of the possible marks based on this assessment, and on the student's journal whi ch would detail the tasks assigned to the student and their level of completion.

## The student will be evaluated on:

- · Quality of work;
- · Use of time (efficient/effective use of time to complete tasks);
- · Ability to take initiative (ability to work independently);
- · Grasp of subject (understanding of applicable standards and procedures);
- · Judgement skills (ability to make appropriate work-related decisions);
- · Interpersonal relations/teamwork (effectiveness in working with peers and supervisors);
- · Adaptability (ability to alter activities to accommodate change);
- · Problem solving/critical thinking skills;
- · Punctuality, attendance;
- · Verbal and written communication skills;
- · Whether the goals of the internship were met (qualitative response);
- · What skills the student developed (qualitative response);
- · The observed primary strengths of the intern (qualitative response);
- · Recommendations for improvement (qualitative response);
- · What is your overall assessment of the student's performance? (qualitative response); and
- · Other relevant observations.

## 75% will be based on the following:

- · Regular communication with the DIC (weekly reports) - 15%
- · Attendance at and participation in required internship meetings (weekly) 10%;
- · Oral presentation summarizing the activities completed during the internship - 20%
- · Documentation of the internship experience in an internship portfolio (30%) which includes:
- · A final report summarizing the internship, relating it to courses done, and  reflecting  on  the  experience.  The  final  report  will  have  an appe ndix containing the student's journal entries from the internship (guidelines will be provided).
- · An updated résumé that incorporates the internship experience.
- · A "company evaluation form' rating the participating organisation.
- · Proof  of  consultation/debriefing  with  the  Office  of  Placement  and Career Services, UWI (Mona).

those  students  wishing  to  develop  their  expertise  within  the  growing  field  of disaster management.

Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are vulnerable to natural hazards, the most devastating of which are hurricanes, volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. Climate related hazards such as the recent passage in 2017 of Hurricanes Irma and Maria have been constant threats to Caribbean islands causing severe devastation to the islands  of  Dominica,  Puerto  Rico  and  Barbuda,  rendering  the  latter  island uninhabitable. Consequently, there is an  urgent need  for stakeholders to understand  the  risks  associated  with  these  hazards  and  to  adopt  appropriate strategies to manage or mitigate such risk.

## PHYSICS WITH EDUCATION (B.Sc.)

## LEVEL 1

Twenty-four  (24)  credits  from  two subject  areas  in  the  Faculty  of  Science  and technology, divided equally between the two so as to provide the Pre-requisites for Level 2 courses (Note that MATH1141 &amp; MATH1185 must be completed prior to pursing Level 3 Physics Department courses). One of the subject areas must be Physics (required courses are PHYS1411, PHYS1412, PHYS1421, PHYS1422 and ELET1405). Foundations of Education courses (see below) may also be taken with Level 1 courses from the Faculty of Science and Technology.

Trained Teachers with the New Double Option (since 2004) with Physics as one of their majors and who have a GPA of at least 2.9 may be granted exemption from Level 1 requirements.

Trained Teachers with Single Option science are required to do Preliminary Physics.

## LEVEL 2

Thirty-six (36) credits are required from Levels 2 and 3 Physics courses such that constitute the General Physics major.

## EDUCATION COURSES

Please consult the Faculty of Humanities &amp; Education regarding the selection of Education Courses.

## REQUIREMENTS FOR A MAJOR IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICS

- · To complete a major offered by the Physics Department, students must successfully attain the thirty-six (36) advanced level (level 2 and level 3) credits.
- · Other department and/or Faculty and/or out-of-Faculty courses (including  Foundation courses) must be done to satisfy the ninety-three (93) credits necessary for award of your degree.
- · A double major within the department is possible only if the Electronics major is a part of the double major.
- o For example, a double major with a major in Electronics and a major in General Physics.
- · A combined major and a minor within the department is possible only if the  major  is  Electronics  OR  if  the  minor  is  either  Renewable  Energy Management or Electronics.
- o For example, a major in Medical Physics with a minor in Electronics or Renewable Energy Management.
- · Double majors may be done with any Physics Department major and a major from another Department.
- o For  example,  a  major  in  Material  Science  with  a  major  in Chemistry.
- · Students pursing the major in Electronics may opt to "specialise" in one of two streams, either Telecommunications or Robotics &amp; Instrumentation. A recommended set of courses for those streams is provided below. Please note that these are suggestions and are not meant to restrict your choice of courses or course combinations.
- · Note that as ELET2420 is a core course for some non-Electronics majors, it cannot be counted as a free elective in Electronics majors.
- · Mathematics courses that are listed are required for completion of Physics majors. For more information on Mathematics courses, please contact the Department  of  Mathematics.  Students  pursuing  both  MATH1142  and MATH1151 otherwise do not need to do MATH1185.
- · Preliminary  Chemistry  courses  or  their  equivalent  are  needed  for  the Materials Science Major.

The table below outlines the courses required for majors in the Department of Physics.

## AWARDS, PRIZES AND BURSARIES

## DEPARTMENT OF CHEMISTRY

## · The Cedric Hassall Scholarship

The Cedric Hassall Prize is the premier award in the Department of Chemistry. It was first awarded as a prize in 1971 and was given to the Chemistry student who had shown the best overall performance in the examinations associated with the first  year  of  advanced Chemistry courses.  This prize  has been upgraded to a Scholarship and is awarded to a final year student majoring in Chemistry who satisfies the above criteria. The scholarship is named in honour of Professor Cedric Hassall (1919-2017), the first Professor of Chemistry at the University and former Head of the Department of Chemistry (1948-1957), who delivered the inaugural lecture  to  the  original  batch  of  medical  students.  It  is  intended  to  foster  and encourage students to  achieve  standards  of  excellence  which  Professor  Hassall insisted should be the hallmark of students pursuing courses in Chemistry. The prize was established largely through the initiative of Professor Gerald Lalor during his tenure as Head of the Department.

## · The Wilfred Chan Award

Wilfred Chan completed the requirements for the BSc degree in 1952 and went on to pursue research under the direction of Prof. Cedric Hassall.  He completed his research in 1956 and was the first West Indian to receive the PhD degree at Mona.  In  1959  he  was  appointed  Lecturer  and  began  a  vigorous  research programme and rose through the ranks to become the first West Indian to be promoted to a personal chair (1971).  In 1966 the Chemistry Department hosted the  first Mona  Symposium  (on  Natural  Products  Chemistry)  with  him  as  its Organizing  Secretary.  Prof.  Chan  later  served  as  Head  of  the  Chemistry Department at Mona from 1972 to 1975.  In 1979 he moved to the St. Augustine Campus to boost research efforts in its young Chemistry Department. He retired from St. Augustine in 1997, having served as Head and Dean during his tenure there. Prof. Chan's contributions over the years to natural products chemistry are internationally recognized.

The Wilfred Chan Award was first made in 2000 and is for a student who has the best academic performance in the advanced Organic Chemistry core courses and who is pursuing a major in Chemistry.  The awardee should not simultaneously hold any other Chemistry Department prize.
