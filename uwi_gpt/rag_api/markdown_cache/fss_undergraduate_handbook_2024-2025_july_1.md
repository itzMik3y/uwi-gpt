## THE UNIVERSITY OF THE WEST INDIES MONA CAMPUS, JAMAICA, WEST INDIES

## FACULTY OF SOCIAL SCIENCES UNDERGRADUATE HANDBOOK

ACADEMIC YEAR 2024-2025

## DISCLAIMER

The Faculty of Social Sciences (FSS) Undergraduate Handbook is provided for the convenience of current and prospective students and staff. It sets out the Faculty's regulations governing the programmes offered; policies and guidelines;  description  of  programmes  and  courses  offered  on  the  Mona Campus, and the Western Jamaica Campus (WJC).

The current edition was finalized in June 2024. A concerted effort was made to eliminate all errors but students must check the Faculty's website and their Department at the start of the semester and during the course of the academic year for updates as well as corrections of any errors or omissions that have come to light subsequent to the finalization of the Handbook. Students should always check with the latest Faculty Handbook when considering programme alternatives and course offerings.

## STRUCTURE OF THE 2024-2025 UNDERGRADUATE HANDBOOK

## Purpose and Scope

This Undergraduate Handbook is intended for use by:

- (i) Prospective students
- (ii) New and continuing students
- (iii) Staff

It  may  be  used  as  a  prospectus,  an  orientation  guide,  and  a  reference handbook  for  the  groups  mentioned  above.  It  is  intended  to  serve  as  a general  source  for  Faculty  regulations  and  programme  information.  The regulations,  however,  are  to  be  used  as  a  supplement  rather  than  a substitute for the official sources of University policies and procedures.

- (i) newly-admitted  students,  i.e.,  students  accepted  to  the  Faculty during the 2024-2025 academic year;
- (ii) students  who  transferred  into  the  Faculty  during  the  2024-2025 academic year;
- (iii) Students approved for a change of Major/Special/Minor during the 2024-2025 academic year;
- (iv) Students who have been readmitted to the University after being unregistered for two semesters or more

## MESSAGE FROM THE DEAN

<!-- image -->

It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to the Faculty of Social Sciences (FSS).  We are the home of the Tigers, and we trust that you will embrace the virtues of strength, determination and resilience. Whatever your programme choice, we can proudly say that you made an excellent decision in choosing The University of the West Indies. Our Faculty is looking forward to seeing you through as successfully and seamlessly as possible, and so we trust that you will absolutely enjoy the journey.  We know how hard you worked to be able to matriculate, and so we expect that you will uphold your side of the bargain by continuing in this vein and committing to personal growth and development through the exploration of clubs and societies, engagement in student leadership, peer counselling, sporting activities, and taking advantage  of  any  other  opportunities.  There  are  many  extracurricular activities aligned  with  your  passions  and  interests.  So,  seek  out  new experiences,  and  let  the  rich,  vibrant  tapestry  of  campus  life  shape  your perspectives and broaden your horizons.  We ask that you incorporate the values of integrity and honesty, ensure ethical behaviour in all that you do, and respect The UWI's rules, regulations, and policies.  We expect too that you will respect yourself, and demonstrate respect for each other and for their differences.

As you begin your university journey, you will need to be self-directed, to manage your time effectively, be intimate with your handbook and course outlines,  do  the  required  readings,  develop  robust  analytical  and  critical thinking skills, and take responsibility for your success. Remember that YOU are in charge of your destiny and progress, but be assured that the Faculty will be your ally. We encourage that as far as is possible, you explore courses that  intrigue  you,  and  step  out  of  your  comfort  zone  and  give  in  to  your curiosity,  and  even  challenge  pre-set  assumptions.  In  addition  to  your  incourse academic training, the Faculty provides opportunities for internships and experiential learning.

While we are interested in ensuring your academic success, we are equally concerned with your mental health and wellbeing. If at any time you feel overwhelmed by the work demands or the pressures of balancing everything

or of life in general, please seek help immediately. Reach out to your lecturers or academic advisors, but remember that professional help may be secured from the UWI Health Centre's counselling services.  You must never think that you are alone on this journey!

Always remember that you have the potential to achieve great things, to contribute outstandingly, and to be impactful.

Enjoy your time with us!

Dr Heather Ricketts Dean, FSS

-  GPA REGULATIONS
-  EXAMINATION REGULATIONS
-  SUMMER SCHOOL REGULATIONS

## GENERAL REGULATIONS FOR THE DEGREE OF BACHELOR OF SCIENCES IN THE FACULTY OF SOCIAL SCIENCES

## Glossary of terms used in these Regulations:

anti-requisites refer to courses where content overlap precludes courses being taken together for credit. Students are urged to view the listing in Part V of this Handbook and consult their Department for guidance.

core/compulsory courses vs elective courses: Programme requirements consist of compulsory  and  elective  courses. While  c ore/compulsory courses are listed by name, there are two types of elective courses. These are(i)  ' free  elective ',  which  can  be  selected  from  any  Department  or Faculty at the appropriate level, or (ii) ' departmental elective' where the discipline  and  level  are  usually  specified.  For  example,  the  requirement may call for 'two Level III Psychology electives' .  Altogether, they must be completed to make up the 90 credits required to be awarded a degree.

course substitution refers  to  cases  where  a  course  is  used  to  replace  a compulsory  or  core  course  in  a  student's  programme  requirements. Students must seek and obtain approval of replacement courses. Please note that course substitution cases are reviewed on a case-by-case basis by the Department.

credit refers  to  a  unit  of  study  counting  towards  a  degree  or  diploma. Undergraduate courses in the Faculty normally carry a weighting of three (3)  credits.  A  number  of  courses,  however,  carry  a  weighting  of  six  (6) credits.

exemption  with  credit refers to cases  where  a  student  is  granted exemption  from  UWI  courses  because  the  student  has  already  passed courses  in  other  programmes  at  the  UWI  or  passed  courses  of  similar content at other recognized institutions. Students are not required to take replacement  courses.  Requests  should  be  made  via  the  Automated Student  Request  System  (ASRS)  accessed  via  Student  Administrative System (SAS).

exemption without credit refers to cases where a student is grantedexemption from UWI courses because s/he has already passedequivalent courses/subjects at other recognized institutions or from other examination bodies. Students granted exemption without credit are required to  takereplacement courses. Requests should be made via the Automated Student Request System (ASRS) accessed via Student Administrative System (SAS).

leave of absence is granted to a student who isunable to continue his/her studies  for  a  semester  or  more  for  financial,  work  related,  personal  or medical  reasons.  Permission  must  be  requested  using  the  Automated Student  Request  System  (ASRS)  accessed  via  the  online  portal  Student Administrative System (SAS).

leveI represents the different standard of courses that must be completed in the degree programme. There are three levels, namely level I, level II, and level III representing the three years for completion of the BSc degree. These  are  designated  by  the  first  numeral  in  the  course  code,  e.g., ECON1002 (level I), GOVT2004 (level II) and SOCI3025 (level III).

pre-requisites are courses which  must  be  completed  before being permitted  to  register  for  a  higher  level  course,  e.g.  PSYC1000  must  be successfully completed before taking PSYC2002.

## 1. ORIENTATION AND ACADEMIC ADVISING

- 1.1 Attendance at orientation by newly-admitted students is mandatory .  During orientation, students will meet the staff, learn about the Faculty, and receive information about their programme of study.
- 1.2 Academic advising, though available to all students throughout the course  of  study,  is  particularly  emphasized  for  new  students.  Its primary purpose is to assist students in planning, monitoring, and successfully managing their chosen field of study, in relation to clear career objectives.
- 1.3 Students who are transferring to the Faculty from another on any UWI  campus  must  also  attend  orientation  and  obtain  academic advising to identify outstanding courses required to complete the programme to which you have been accepted.
- 1.4 Students who have been readmitted under Academic Forgiveness having been Required to Withdraw, should also ensure that they attend Orientation to: (1) confirm the courses that they are being allowed to bring over; (2) apply for Exemptions for the courses; and, (3)  confirm  the  outstanding  courses  required  to  complete  the programme to which you have been readmitted. Students in this situation should note that they will be readmitted into the currently offered programme closest to their most recent programme, where relevant.

## 2. COURSE CREDITS AND WEIGHTING REGULATIONS

- 2.1 Normally,  each  undergraduate  course  in  the  Faculty  carries  a weighting of three (3) credits.
- 2.2 Courses  taught  over  an  academic  year  (i.e.year-long  or  across Semesters  1  and  2)  normally  carry  a  weighting  of  six  (6)  credits. Students must register for the course in both Semesters.
- 2.3 In the case of substitution for a 6-credit course, the alternative is either another 6-credit course or two 3-credit courses.
- 2.4 Credit hours earned refers to the credits for each course that count toward the degree requirement and for which a passing grade is obtained. See below for a definition of credit hours according to the Board for Undergraduate Studies (May 2015):

- (b) a  minimum of TWO hours of supervised laboratory work per week per semester;
- (c) or at least FOUR hours of directed learning activities (including project work, research work, practicum and internships) undertaken by the student out of class per week per semester.

Revision  conducted  during  the  three-week  formal  examination period at the end of the Semester is subsumed in this definition on a pro-rata basis.

- 2.5 Credit hours earned in courses taken on a Pass/Fail  basis are not included in calculating GPA.
- 2.6 Credits  hours  earned  from  another  institution  at  the  time  of admission to the UWI are not used in the computation of GPA.

## 10. ACADEMIC FORGIVENESS

- 10.1 Academic Forgiveness is normally applied to students who withdraw either  voluntarily  or  because  the  University  required  them  to withdraw.The Guiding Principle is to preserve the integrity of the programme the student is expected to complete.
- 10.2 To obtain academic forgivenessstudents required to withdraw must remain out of the UWI system for a minimum of one year  if  the student intends to remain in their original Faculty. Students who are ineligible for a waiver  must  transfer  to  another  Faculty  and complete their degree in that new Faulty if they are not willing to remain out for a year whilst needing Academic Forgiveness.
- 10.3 When students who have been granted academic forgiveness are re-admitted to UWI, the Dean of the Faculty will determine which courses,  if  any,  may  be  used  as  transfer  credits.  The  maximum number of transfer credits is 30 credits which would normally be Level 1 in accordance with Statute 47.
- 10.4 The Dean,with permission of the Board for Undergraduate Studies (BUS), may determine which Level II or III courses may be considered for exemption WITH  credit when  a student was previously withdrawn.  A  maximum  of  two  (2)  Level  II/III  courses  can  be  so considered and both must have a minimum grade of B-; these two courses are part of the 30 credits referenced above.
- 10.5 When a student either transfers from one Faculty to another(see Cross Faculty and Cross Campus Transfers, section 11), he/she can benefit  from  academic forgiveness without  waiting out  one year. Exemptions will be determined by the Faculty to which he/she has been  accepted.  Where  a  student  is  granted  a  waiver  of  the requirement to withdraw, without remaining out of the UWI system for a minimum of one year, s/he is considered a continuing student and is ineligible for academic forgiveness.
- 10.6 Where  students  are  to  benefit  from  the  exemptions  indicated above, they must apply on the Automated Student Request Module at the point of readmission in order to ensure that their record is fully updated and to facilitate the credit check/degree audit process.

Students should note that each course on the timetable appears in one of four time slots  that  are  further  segmented  into Slot  A,  Slot  B,  and  Slot  C to facilitate the meeting of each course 3 times per week for a total of six  hours.  Students  should  check  the  timetable  carefully  to  ensure that they do not select 'clashed courses'. Refunds will not be granted for any 'clashed course' save where a student registered for a course on  a  previous  version  of  the  timetable,  and  a  current timetable change resulted in the clash.

## 18.8 Examinations, Course Load

Students  can  register  for  a  maximum  of  TWO  courses  within  the Faculty  (including Exams  Only ).  Students  are  advised  to  check  the timetable  before  registering.  Examination  procedures  will  be  the same  as  those  that  apply  for  the  end  of  semester  examinations. Finalizing students can apply to do a third course through the Faculty Coordinator. A student is deemed as finalizing if that student has only 3 or 4 courses remaining to complete the degree programme.

## 18.9 Withdrawal

Students may withdraw at anytime from a course or all coursesduring the normal registration period.  After the normal registration period has passed students who wish to withdraw from a course may request to drop the course using the Automated Student Request System (ASRS). The request may be granted if no coursework was completed and may be subject to a late fine to be determined by the Academic Board.

## 18.10 Payment of Fees

Students are required to select their course(s) online before making payment.  Cash,  Manager's  cheque,  Debit  and  Credit  cards  will  be accepted as payment for Summer School courses. Part payment of fees is  NOT allowed. Fee  payment can be made at the UWI Mona Bursary Cashier, Bill Express, Paymaster or the National Commercial Bank.

## Message from the Head of Department

<!-- image -->

Welcome to the Department of Economics! You have made the right choice. The  Department  of  Economics  was  established  in  1955.  Back  then  it  was actually in the Faculty of Arts. Several well-known national, and international, leaders have walked along the paths that you will be travelling on for the next three years and sat in the same classrooms gazing at the same black/white boards. These include our very own Dr. Andre Haughton who was recently appointed to the opposition shadow cabinet, as well as Dr. Carla Bennett, the first female Secretary General of the Caribbean Community.

A  degree  in  Economics  will  offer  you  a  copious  amount  of  vocational flexibility and  will  lay  a  solid  foundation  for  a  wide  range  of  career opportunities.  We therefore encourage you to use the next few years to learn as much as you can, not just academically, but also about who you are and who you want to be.  While many of our alumni are in the traditional roles that degrees in Economics, Statistics or Banking &amp; Finance may take you, the knowledge, skills, and tools that you will receive over the next 3 years are highly and easily transferable to other disciplines. The possibilities are endless!

Our  dedicated,  knowledgeable,  approachable,  friendly,  and  professional administrators are always willing to assist you in navigating this new learning experience. They have prepared this handbook which provides indispensable details about the different majors and minors offered by the department. The interdisciplinary nature of your degree allows you to also explore other areas of interest.  While doing your undergraduate degree, I also implore you to consider pursuing either a M.Sc. in Economics and/or a Ph.D. in Economics, as an advanced degree, especially in this discipline, will significantly increase your future earning potential. If this path interests you, I highly recommend double  majoring  in  Economics  and  Mathematics  so  that  you  gain  the necessary skills to prepare you for graduate work.

I  cannot  end  this  message  without  encouraging  you  to  participate  in  the social life of the  faculty  and  the  wider  university.  There  are  various clubs/societies/organizations  that  you  can  join  in  order  to  enrich  your experience and develop your soft skills. By doing this you will hone your time management  skills,  maintain  your  mental  health,  and  gain  leadership experience. Of particular interest is the Young Economist Association or the Young Investor's Club who over the years have added value to our students through networking events and relevant presentations.

Whether  you  are  a  new  or  returning  student,  you  are  now  part  of  a department that is a beacon of excellence and innovation on this campus, so I charge you to REACH FOR THE STARS!

Dr Patrice Whitely

## MONA SCHOOL OF BUSINESS AND MANAGEMENT Message from the Executive Director

<!-- image -->

Welcome to the University of the West Indies, and in particular the Mona School of Business and Management! (MSBM). We are thrilled to have you join our family and look forward to interacting with you at either the Mona or Western Jamaica Campus.

Our dedicated faculty, staff and fellow students are here to help you as you embark on this new journey. In this period of your life you may notice many juxtapositions, you are an adult but a student, your life may be challenging yet exhilarating, you have rights but you also have responsibilities. Some of those responsibilities include: attending classes, submitting assignments in a timely manner and tracking you academic progression. While lectures and tutorials  are  critical  to  your  success,  it  is  your  responsibility  to  follow recommended readings and all activities as at the undergraduate level we expect  that  you  will  be  doing  work  beyond  what  is  taught  solely  during lectures.

This  handbook  is  the  first  guide  to  learning  about  and  choosing  your preferred courses and majors for your undergraduate degree. It is important to pay particular attention to pre-requisites, as this is vital to ensuring that you complete your programme of study in the prescribed time. Please seek academic advice as you design your roadmap for your programme. MSBM will also host student engagement activities to help guide you along the way.

There are many opportunities available to you as a student of this university, please utilise  them  and  in  particular  apply  for  scholarships  and  bursaries. Very  significantly,  in  order  to  have  a  balanced  student  life,  please  take advantage of the wide range of clubs, sporting and other social activities that are on offer.

Welcome  once  again  to  the  MSBM,  I  wish  you  a  successful  and  fulfilling experience and look forward to meeting as many of you as I can in person.

## DEPARTMENT OF SOCIOLOGY, PSYCHOLOGY &amp; SOCIAL WORK Message from the Head of Department

<!-- image -->

Welcome to the Department of Sociology, Psychology and Social Work! As you may have already discovered, our focus is on the behavioural sciences, including Anthropology, Demography, Development, Human  Resource Development, and Social Policy. As new and returning students you come from various geo-social zones and socio-economic backgrounds that shape your views on how the world operates. In your time here with us there will be  opportunities  and  challenges;  but  we  hope  that  even  the  latter  will provide space for learning and the formation of new friendships.

We know you are aware that many of our staff are experts in various areas of the behavioural sciences. You may see them on your television or hear them on the radio, or you may have grown up using their books in school. However, you may not be aware that we are excited to have you and listen to some of the ideas you have to share with us. We have a strong tradition of  working  with  our  students  on  various  projects,  thus  creating  the  next generation of scholars who will help us meet the University's mission  'To advance  learning,  create  knowledge  and  foster  innovation  for  the positive transformation of the Caribbean and the wider world.'

Given the various social crises in Jamaica and the rest of the Caribbean, there  are no  debates  surrounding  the  critical importance  of  our department. Our graduates have made tremendous contributions to the development of the region and the wider world in the areas of violence reduction, labour relations, politics, security, mental health, and social care. We welcome your input in the sustainability of this rich tradition of regional and international impact. But first, we start by teaching you in an environment in which you have a voice; and can feel free to express how  you  wish  to  shape  the  future.  Thus,  we  promise  you  a  studentcentred environment in which you are the customer; and we hope you will see  yourselves  as  part-owners  of  the  academic  experience.  In closing, we hope that when your journey here is complete, and you stop to reflect, you will be able to list your studies with us among the happy times.

## DEPARTMENT INFORMATION AND GUIDELINES

- 1. The Department of Sociology, Psychology and Social Work offers BSc. degrees and diplomas in the following areas:
-  Demography (Minor)
-  Human Resource Development (Minor)
-  Labour and Employment Relations (Major)
-  Population and Development (Diploma)
-  Psychology (Major, Minor and Diploma)
-  Social Anthropology (Major and Minor)
-  Social Policy and Development (Minor)
-  Social Psychology (Minor)
-  Social Work (Special)
-  Sociology (Major, Minor and Diploma)
- 2. Students  must  satisfy  the  programme  requirements  as  set  out  in  the Faculty  Handbook  as  at  the  year  in  which  they  were  accepted  to  the programme.
- 3. Students should consult course descriptions when selecting electives. The choice of electives should complement the major field of study.
- 4. Electives at Levels II and III must be from either Level II or III courses. Level III courses may be taken in year 2 as long as the pre-requisites have been met.
- 5. All courses are for 3 credits except where otherwise indicated.
- 6. Most Levels II and III courses have pre-requisites as you will see from the list of courses being offered in Part V of this Handbook.
- 7. While  double  Majors  are  permitted,  the  Department  prefers  that students select a single Major (and a Minor by choice). This allows a wider choice of electives which can serve to strengthen the Major or the Minor.
- 8. Where  the  same  course  is  listed  for  both  a  Major  and  a  Minor,  it  is counted only ONCE therefore, an additional approved course must also be taken to complete the required total of 60 credits at Levels II and III.
- 9. Students taking double Majors in Sociology and Psychology, or Sociology and  Demography,  may  only  apply  the  required  course,  SOCI2008: Statistics for Behavioural Sciences, to ONE of the Majors and must then select an additional Level II/III course to complete the ten (10) courses for the other Major.

- 10.EDRS2007: Basic Research Methods is accepted as a substitute wherever SOCI1001: Introduction to Social Research is listed.
- 11.ECON1005: Introduction to Statistics is accepted as a substitute wherever S0CI1005: Introduction to Statistics for the Behavioural Sciences is listed.
- 12.The combination of PSYC1005: Research Methods in Social, Developmental  and  Abnormal  Psychology  and  PSYC1006:  Research Methods in Cognitive and Physiological Psychology are accepted IN LIEU OF SOCI1001: Introduction to Social Research as A PRE-REQUISITE FOR A COURSE. This is only applicable to Psychology Majors (or 'Double Majors' doing Psychology as their second major)

## 13. Coursework Guidelines

-  Coursework refers to pieces of assigned work during the semester.  It would  usually  take  the  form  of  all  or  some  of  the  following:  midsemester  exam,  an  essay,  group,  individual  or  class  presentation, research proposal, and  where  necessary, labs/practicals. At the beginning  of  each  semester  a  'course  outline'  is  prepared  for  each course.  On  this  course  outline  all  indications  of  course  content,  due dates for assignments, room, contact information and office hours of lecturers must be clearly printed.
-  Coursework assignments should be marked and returned to students prior  to  examinations.  A  principal  objective  of  coursework  is  that feedback  can  be  given  to  each  student  as  an  aid  to  learning.    This distinguishes it from the conditions pertaining to the final examination.
-  Where 'in-course' tests are being administered, these should normally be no later than the 8 th week of the semester, unless there is no final examination.
-  Where both written coursework and 'in-course' tests are being used as a  method  of  assessment,  these  should  be  scheduled  at  least  three weeks apart, unless there is no final examination.
-  Coursework submitted after the due date will be subject to a deduction of 5% of the coursework marks for each day late, (i.e., 1 mark out of 20 per day).
-  Exemption  from  a  penalty  will  only  be  considered  if  an  excuse  is submitted  in  writing.  This  will  have  to  relate  to  illness  (medical certificate required), serious domestic problems and in the instance of

part  time  students  only,  significant  work-related  problems.  In  such instances the lecturer may grant an extension for a specified period or may refer the request for the discretion of the Head of Department for a final decision.

-  Excuses must be submitted prior to the due date for submission of the coursework.
-  In the event that a student has completed coursework and is excused from  sitting  the  final  exam  (illness  or  other  special  circumstances), coursework marks may be carried over to the next available sitting of the course.  Should there be an increase in the proportion of marks allotted for the next sitting, a further assignment may be required for the additional marks.
-  In all undergraduate offerings, students must obtain at least 25% of the marks assigned for coursework for successful completion of the course [i.e., where  40  marks  or  40%  of  the  full  course  is  assigned  for coursework, a minimum of 10 marks must be obtained].
-  In cases where a student is dissatisfied with his/her final examination grade,  the  matter  may  be  directed  to  the  Examinations  Office  for  a review, re-mark or a go-through.
- 14.The  ' Undergraduate  Coursework  Accountability  Statement' is to  be attached by students registered for undergraduate courses in the Faculty to the front of any document submitted as a component of coursework, save for when coursework consists of an invigilated examination. Where the submission is entirely in electronic form, the student shall make an equivalent declaration electronically. (Students may download a copy of the Statement from the Faculty's website).

## 15. Exemption Without Credit for CAPE Subjects

See page 30: Section 6.2 for details

- 16. Anti-Requisites: These  are  courses  that cannot  be  taken  together for credit.    Students  are  urged  to  view  the  complete  list  of  anti-requisite courses in PART IV of this Handbook. For example, Psychology Majors are not  to  register  for  SOCI1001-  Introduction  to  Social  Research  because they  are  required  to  do  PSYC1005  and  PSYC1006  as  their  first  year research courses. As a result, anywhere SOCI1001-Introduction to Social Research appears as a pre-requisite, Psychology Majors can select that course once they have the psychology equivalent.

17.Full-time and part-time students may register for a maximum of 30 credits (10 courses) and 18 credits (6 courses) in an academic year, respectively. See Full-time and Part-time Regulations in Part III of this Handbook.

We  pride  ourselves  as  an  institution  with  a  chernozem  of information  on  persons  with  disabilities.  Through  our  research,  training, advocacy and public education, we have seen a more data driven focus to public policy formulation on issues relating to members of this marginalized community.  Our  recently  published  Regional  Disability  Index  (RDI)  which ranks countries in the Caribbean in terms of their efforts to implement the provisions of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) is a perfect example of our high quality research on the subject of disability.  Students  at  the  UWI  continue  to  look  towards  the  UWICDS  for guidance in their research on this burgeoning subject.

As  governments within the Caribbean implement a plethora of legislation and policies to protect and empower persons with disabilities, there is an urgent need for trained professionals who have a pellucid understanding of persons with disabilities. Recognizing this national and regional imperative, the UWICDS has moved to capitalize on this situation. Since September 2019, we  have  been  offering  three  courses  that  equip  and  strengthen  the marketability of our graduates through academic exposures which will place them  on  the  cutting  edge  in  the  labour  market  where  persons  with disabilities are concerned. Understanding Persons with Disabilities

(DBST1000);  Disability,  Law  and  Society  (DBST2000)  and  Disability  and Development  (DBST3000)  are  courses  that  will  give  you  an  intricate understanding  of  the  subject  of  disability  and  will  prepare  you  for  the tremendous employment opportunities as governments execute their new disability plans.

We are confident that your association with us will enrich your university experience.  You  will  get  the  opportunity  to  interact  with  persons  with disabilities, including Senator Dr. Floyd Morris, who is the first blind person to sit in the Parliament of Jamaica and ultimately became President of that noble institution.

Knowledge  is  power  and  the  UWI  and  all  its  departments,  centres  and institutes are all equipped with lots of it and this will result in you becoming a  powerful  individual.  Take  use  of  these  opportunities  and  enjoy  your university experience. The sky is the limit.

Professor Floyd Morris, PhD

Under  the  heading  of,  'microeconomics',  theories  of consumer and firm behavior are introduced along with an explanation of the various  types  of  market  structures.  For  'macroeconomics',  the  course presents  theories  of  long  run  economic  growth  and  short  run  economic fluctuations.

The  course  bridges  the gap  between  the  conceptual  introduction  in ECON1000 and the more rigorous and structured theories of the intermediate courses offered at Level II.  This course serves two purposes:

- i. It  provides  an  opportunity  for  the  non-economics  major  who  has enjoyed introduction to economics in ECON1000 and wants to add more to their knowledge of economics.
- ii. It provides an upgrade path for the student who has taken ECON1000 and wishes to major or minor in economics.

Selected topics in market failure are also treated. The methodology is again primarily partial equilibrium analysis with some  exposure  to  general equilibrium analysis.

Outline  Theory of the Firm in Imperfectly Competitive Markets, Theory of : Income  Distribution,  Market  failure,  General  Equilibrium  and  Economic Welfare.

## ECON2002: INTERMEDIATE MACROECONOMICS I

The  purpose  of  this  course  is  to  present  the  student  with  a  theoretical framework  within  which  to  understand  the  issue  of  fluctuations  in  an economy. The framework is quite general, and does not itself focus on any particular economy. However, by the end of the course, you should be able to  use  this  theoretical  framework  to  understand  the  economic  issues currently relevant to Caribbean economies, such as:1) Why did the inflation rate in Jamaica fall so dramatically over the last five years?

- 2)    Why  are  interest  rates  lower  in  the  OECS  (Organization  of  Eastern Caribbean States) countries than they are in Jamaica and Trinidad?
- 3)  How has Barbados managed to maintain exchange rate stability for 20 years?  Equally important, by the end of the course you should have become familiar with some of the methodologies of macroeconomic analysis, which has broader applications outside of the issues to which we apply them. This course does not take off immediately from where Introduction to Macroeconomics, your first year course, ended.

Extensive use is made of matrix algebra throughout. The CLRM is reviewed and  the  properties  of  the  ordinary  least  squares  estimators  discussed. Students are exposed to alternative estimation techniques including the use of  instrumental  variables,  the  method  of  maximum  likelihood  and  the method of moments. The course covers advanced topics including models with lagged dependent variables, simultaneous equation systems and time series  econometrics.  Diagnostic  problems  and  problems  of  estimation  are emphasized.  A  project  paper  is  required  from  each  student.  Specific  case studies  will  be  taken  from  Caribbean  economic  activity  and  econometric models of various Caribbean countries will be reviewed.

## ECON3069: PUBLIC POLICY

This course will provide the student with an understanding of the processes, design and implementation of public economic policy with emphasis on the Caribbean economic environment. It proceeds from a review of the nature of public economic policy and its underpinnings in economic theory, through the role of market and governmental failure, and conceptual issues in the formation and implementation of public policy, to the examination of specific areas of policy design and implementation.

The purpose of this course is to give students a critical appreciation of the economic policy design and implementation process. The standard economic theory course rigorously develops theory and  concepts of economic relationships  as  its  central  focus,  then  adding  policy  implications  of  the theory. With the focus on theory, there is often insufficient time to look at the process of policy design and implementation and to critically evaluate the actual policy process, including the explicit and implicit theoretical and/or ideological underpinnings. This course in Public Policy offers the student a stronger  central  focus  on  the  economic  policy  process  and  a  capacity  for critical  evaluation  of  policy  process  and  content.  The  course  will  extend beyond conceptual issues in public policy to outline specific areas of socioeconomic (e.g. human capital) and macroeconomic policy (include specific issues in market liberalization and international trade).

including  the  valuation  of  bonds,  equity  and  derivatives  as  well  as  the measurement of risk. On the financing side of the financial market, capital budgeting  and  financing  costs evaluation methods  are  assessed.  The underlying  modern  capital  market  theory  is  reviewed  along  with  Fisher's separability theorem and the Modigliani-Miller theorem.

## ECON3073: CREDIT ANALYSIS AND LENDING

## GOVT2007: POLITICS IN THE CARIBBEAN

This  course  focuses  on  the  structure  of  and  current  controversies  in Caribbean political systems from a comparative perspective. Many of these have to do with elections and electoral systems, political parties and party systems, the nature of political opposition, the nature of government and reforms of the state, human rights and human development, justice, crime and  corruption,  models  of  economic  development,  and  the  impact  of globalization. These problems are discussed in the context of the challenges faced  by  the  Caribbean  to  meet  acceptable  standards  of  democracy, development  and  globalization.  This  assessment  is  useful  against  the background of certain failures in human, economic and political development  in  the  region  and  the  need  to  explore  possible  corrective measures.

General  issues  of  consideration include  how  and  why  the  system  developed  in  the  region  as  it  did;  how theories  relate  to  policies  and  how  the  existing  system  may  be  reformed and/or transformed. Considerable attention will be devoted to the relevance of the ideas discussed to contemporary Caribbean societies.

## GOVT2012:  POPULAR  JAMAICAN  MUSIC  1962-1982:  ROOTS  LYRICS  AS SOCIO-POLITICAL PHILOSOPHICAL TEXT

- It highlights the relations among  fiscal and monetary  policies, debt management  and  administrative decision-making. While students are

exposed  to  public  financial  management  in  Jamaica  they  are  directed  to appreciate  the  issues  pertaining  to  this  subject  in  other  territories  in  the Caribbean as well as in a global setting.

## GOVT2037: PUBLIC MANAGEMENT ANALYSIS

The purpose of this course is to introduce students to public management issues  and  problems  from  both  an  institutional  and  an  organizational perspective  and  for  them  to  develop  the  habit  of  thinking  systematically about problem-solving by way of design, development and assessment of appropriate policies, strategies and tools.

## GOVT2038: PUBLIC AND POLICY MANAGEMENT DISCOURSES

This  course  exposes  students  systematically  to  the  complex  and  evolving nature of the field and practice of public/policy management and for them to develop an appreciation for the value of the 'debate element' to public decision-making. It responds to the objective of providing students with an overarching view of critical issues and themes that populate the policy/public management  discourse/agenda  at  any  given  juncture.  Thus,  its  modular design although sets the broad parameters for content, permits flexibility in the issues/themes that are omitted or included at intervals. Its status as a level two course makes it an imperative that a lock-step approach is applied in its design. As a consequence this course builds on the content and skillsbase of level 1 study in the sub-discipline and prepares students for level 3. It employs the core pillars of teaching and learning, viz., reading, writing and speaking to  build  skills  and  competences in: research and analysis; critical reasoning, thinking and writing; and argumentation. Throughout this course the 'contested' nature of theory and praxis is emphasized.

## GOVT2044: RESEARCH METHODS IN GOVERNANCE I

This course is the first of two courses which introduces students to research methods in governance. The course builds on the elementary knowledge of social research, political science and statistics provided in the first year of the degree programme. It is designed to provide students with a grounding in theories, methodologies, methods and the processes of empirical political science research. Students will be able to engage in discussions regarding how and why political science research is conducted. They will learn to test as  well  as  develop  political  theories.  The  course  will  give  students  key knowledge and analytical skills to plan a political science research proposal as well as the capacity to evaluate the research done by others. Emphasis will also be placed on developing a basic understanding of the philosophy and the  logic underlying  social-scientific inquiry, and  appropriate  research strategies, both quantitative and qualitative. Students will develop a research proposal  which  outlines  the background  for  the  study,  the research question(s) and hypotheses, the literature review, a comprehensive research design as well as the delimitation and limitations of the study. Topics to be

covered include the theoretical paradigms underlying political/policy research,  conceptualisation  and  operationalisation,  measurement  theory, common data-collection strategies, training in use of computers and SPSS, and the completion of a full research proposal.

## GOVT2046:  INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS: THEORIES AND APPROACHES

This  course  covers  a  sample  of  the  old,  the  new  and  the  different  in  the theoretical discourse of the discipline of International Relations. It takes as its starting point the view that theory helps us to understand the world and to understand why we, as individuals think the way we do. Thus students are encouraged to critically assess not just other people's ideas about International Relations but their own as well.

## GOVT2047: PRINCIPLES OF PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW

This course  provides  an  introduction  to  Public  International  Law  and considers the contribution made  by  Public  International Law  to the preservation of friendly relations between the states. Emphasis is placed on the more practical aspects of the law, with focus on topics which those who enter the professional sphere of foreign affairs are expected to encounter on a  regular  basis.  Such  topics  include  jurisdiction  and  immunities,  state responsibility and recognition. Some attempt is made to cover the role of law in wider international political issues such as terrorism and regional conflict.

## GOVT2048: INTERNATIONAL AND REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

This course provides an introduction to International Organizations, emphasizing co-operative activities involving governments. It concentrates on critically examining the theories, origin, structures and current status of international and regional organizations in the study of world politics.

## GOVT2049:  INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY

This course is based on the premise that the study of International Relations must take into account the inter-relationship between the economic and the political.  It introduces  students  to  political  economic  perspectives  and applies  this  analytic  approach  to  the  study  of  such  issues  as  the  liberal international economic order and distributive justice, and the international financial system and policy co-ordination.

## GOVT2050: CONSTITUTIONAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE LAW FOR PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGERS

This is an introductory course on the intersection of public service with law. Civil  servants,  the  role  of  law  and  the  courts  along  with  the  Jamaican constitution are considered inter-related topics. Course design is such that Public Policy and Management students learn about the legal system (both in  Jamaica and in a comparative sense) while also providing insight to the particular concerns, contradictions and outcomes of public service life. The

relationship  between  civil  servant  and  lawyer  is  often  adversarial.  This  is unfortunate  given  their  complementary  tasks  to  ensure  that  government runs effectively, economically, efficiently and equitably toward the service of its  citizens.  The  rule  of  law  and  the  relationships  of  courts  and  judges  to administrative life are integral to public service.

## GOVT2054: RESEARCH METHODS IN GOVERNANCE II

This course is the second of two courses which focuses on the application of research  methods  in governance.  The  course  specifically  focuses  on  data collection  techniques  as  well  as  analyzing  qualitative,  quantitative  and mixed-methods data for governance. It is designed for students who will be working with local and international political stakeholders as well as those doing  public  policy  related  work.  Students  will  learn  how  to  collect  and analyze different forms of data through the use of various methods, tools and techniques. This course cultivates students' analytical abilities and develops their statistical reasoning while offering students an introduction to the key empirical  methods  required  for  collecting,  and  analyzing  data  used  to undertake project, programmes, or initiatives in governance. In an effort to demonstrate the data collection methods and data analysis processes as well as  linking  these  methods  and  processes  to  ongoing  governance  related debates, students will conduct hands-on research data analysis procedures geared  towards  giving  them  a  better  understanding  of  doing  governance related research. They will be able to appreciate and understand the pivotal role of descriptive and inferential statistics as well as qualitative data and associated analytical tools. The topics that will be covered include:

- i. Quantitative  Data  Analysis  -  univariate,  bivariate  and  multivariate analysis
- ii. Qualitative  Data  Analysis  -  case  study  analysis,  qualitative  descriptive analysis, content analysis, and policy evaluation analysis as well as
- iii. Mixed Methods Data Analysis

## GOVT2070: POLITICAL MANAGEMENT AND STRATEGY

Political  strategists,  expert  consulting  and  media  firms,  managerial  and organizational  systems,  management  and  voter  mobilization  techniques, fundraising and new technological tools are just some of the tools, actors and techniques that are currently being used to enhance the political process, gain  leverage  in  political  practice  and  in  the  execution  of  government activities by political leaders and political parties. In this course students will learn about the tools, actors, techniques and processes apolitical management  and  strategy.  Students  will  engage  in  discussions  regarding approaches that political actors are using to gain a competitive advantage in the  political  process.  They  will  also  learn  how  to  utilize  these  tools  and techniques.  The  course  is  designed  to  give  students  key  knowledge  and analytical skills relevant in political consulting, political campaigning, resource management, political management, advocacy and lobbying, the

use  of  social  media,  political  fundraising  and  other  aspects  of  political management and strategy.

## GOVT2071: CLIMATE CHANGE, GOVERNANCE AND DEVELOPMENT

This  course  explores  the  genesis  of  climate  change  and  the  fundamental concepts and scientific constructs underpinning and driving this phenomenon. The role of the scientific and international communities has been critical in trying to understand the role of anthropogenic activity and the implications for ecosystems, the environment and what is required to enable  a  symbiotic  and  beneficial  coexistence  between  man  and  nature. Against  this  backdrop,  global  political  economy  themes  and  interests,  the responses of states and dominant actors within political, global public policy and governance regimes will be explored. Students will gain an appreciation of  the  key  issues  and  principles  surrounding  climate  change,  juxtaposed against the global community and small vulnerable economies responding to the imperative of development, while treating with the challenges climate change presents.

## GOVT2177: POLITICAL BEHAVIOUR

With  the  decoding  of  the  human  genome  and  the  growing  research  on biology  and  political  behavior,  this  course  deals  with  how  interaction  of genes,  physiology,  neurology  and  the  political environment  influences political  attitudes,  political  participation,  and  ideology.  The  interactionalso influences political trust, vote choice, party identification, political sophistication,  party  identification, views  ofthe  out-group  and  political violence  and  so  on.  Therefore,  this  course  surveys  the  range  of  political behaviors that are driven by the biology-environment interaction.

## GOVT2267: POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY OF THE CARIBBEAN

The course examines seminal social and political theories which speak to the relationship among  the development of the state, capitalism, globalisation,  and  liberalism.The  impact  that  social  cleavages  such  as class,religion,race and gender have on parties, elections and other political institutions will be explored. We will also examine the strength and political impact of both labour movements and other important social movements which have been key centres of change in the Caribbean setting. The impact of colonialism will also be a key consideration.

## GOVT2268: GENDER, GOVERNANCE AND LEADERSHIP

History has shown that Caribbean women were never satisfied with being on  the  peripheries  of  the  political  arena,and  over  the  years,they  have engaged in activism and adopted different kinds of strategies in order to gain  entry  to  the  structures  of  governance.  Despite  the  expansion  of scholarship  over  the  years,  very  little  is  known  about  the  challenges theyface in the attempt to enter into representational politics since they

still  occupy  astatistical  minority  in  the  parliaments  of  the  majority  of countries  across the world. In the Anglophone  Caribbean,only  four countries  so  far,  have  had  female  Prime  Ministers.  Still,  there  is  limited knowledge  concerning  the  extent  to  which  female  presence  within  the structures of governance will impact substantive representation especially in light of contemporary research which shows that thereis an empirical link between  the  descriptive  and  substantive  representation  of  women,by women. Thiscourseis designed to address the gaps and will engage students in  a  varietyof  debates  on  theoretical  and  socio-cultural  issues  and  how these issues mayhave helped to determine the gender ofgovernance and subsequently, influence the governance of gender.

## GOVT2269: SOCIAL MOVEMENTS IN THE CARIBBEAN

Social movements have historically played a part in shaping the political and socio-cultural  landscape  ofthe  Caribbean  asthe  subordinated  and  the oppressed have always sought to challenge the conditions, circumstances and  rules  that  control  their  lives.The  historical  processes  of  slavery  and colonialism inthe Caribbean have had a profound impact on the emergence of social movements in the past generally, but a variety of social movements still exist incontemporary  times.This suggests that the reare issues, grievances, tensions and particular facilitating conditions at different levels in society that influence movement formation. Contemporary movements range from the animal rights movement, environmental or green movement, feminist movement,to abortion rights movement,among others.  However,  very  little  is  known  concerning  the  extent  to  which collective  refusal  to  accept  restrictions,  boundaries  hegemonic  controlof one group over another,abuse and misuse of resources, among others, may impact  established  laws,  rules  and  policies,  as  well  as  the  relationship between movements, community power, leadership from below onestablished structures and state politics.

## GOVT3008: COMPARATIVE REVOLUTIONS

The aim is to acquaint the student with the rich theoretical and narrative history on revolutionary movements in the light of the practical experiences of a selection of contemporary and history revolutions. It will be divided into two  parts.  The  first  will  examine  the  various  theories  on  the  causes  of revolutions, through  Marx,  Brinton,  Johnson,  Tilly, Barrington  Moore, Trimberger, Theda Skocpol, to Wallerstein, Eisenstadt and Unger. The second will survey in detail the experience of Cuba, Grenada and Nicaragua in the light of the other contemporary and historical examples of revolution and of the theoretical constructs established in the first part.  From time to time the examples  of  revolution  may  be  varied  to  reflect  the  rich  and  variegated international experience.

## GOVT3010: PUNISHMENT AND CORRECTIONS

This  course  examines  the  development  of  ideologies  pertaining  to  the punishment  of  offenders.  It  explores  the  rationale  for  imprisonment, including retribution, incapacitation, and rehabilitation and critically examines  past  and  existing  penal  doctrines  in  Jamaica.  Alternatives  to incarceration  and  current  ideas  about  penal  reform  are  also  critically examined.

## GOVT3011: VIOLENCE AND DEVELOPMENT

This  course  examines  historical  changes  in  the  patterns  and  meanings  of violence globally. Special attention is paid to individual, collective and state violence in the Caribbean context. The main theories explaining the causes of violence and current research on attitudes to violence and the use of force to  bring  about  social  political  change  are  reviewed.  Strategies  of  conflict management and prevention and their relationship to the development and transformation  of  political  culture  and  state  institutions  that  seek  to monopolize the legitimate use of violence are discussed.

## GOVT3012: CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL ISSUES

This course will focus on issues of current relevance in industrial societies, with emphasis on Western Europe and North America. It will analyze the extent of cynicism towards politics, the various tendencies in the political system, issues of economic transformation and changes in the state.

This  course  examines  the  effects  of  corruption, identifies the contexts within  which  it flourishes, explores means  of measuring  it,  and  analyses  the  opportunity  structure  for  corruption.  The United  Nations  Convention  against  Corruption  (UNCAC)  has  now  been ratified by 165 countries demonstrating that there is now an international

consensus both that preventing and addressing corruption is a high global priority.  Actions  to  identify  the  type  and  range  of  measures  that  must  be taken  by  various  stakeholders  in  order  to  reduce  corruption  globally  are underway.  At  its  core,  the  Convention  promotes  key  transparency  and accountability principles that are of equal importance to both the public and private sectors and civil society. The course also exposes students to other regional  instruments  of  importance  such  as  Inter-American  Convention against Corruption, OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials  and  the  AU  Convention,  Council  of  Europe  Conventions,  OAS Convention,  and  EU  Instruments.

Second, it analyses of the main security challenges (both past and present), such as the role of nuclear weapons proliferation and the arms race as threats to international security, as well as the significance of drug trafficking for the Caribbean  region.  Special  emphasis  will  be  placed  on  the  ways  in  which individual states and organizations, particularly the United Nations (UN), the Organization of American States (OAS), and the Regional Security System, respond to these security challenges.

While maintaining the traditional state-centric approach in highlighting the role  of  the  nation-state  in  responding  to  these  changes,  students  will  be introduced to the new international reality of non-state actors, for example drug traffickers in posing threats to the system. They will also be introduced to the formulation of security responses which excludes the state, such as private  security  (including  the  establishment  of  security  companies  to protect citizens based on a perception of the failure of the State to provide such security).

This  course  covers  the  same  material  as  ECON1005,  but  focuses  more  on social and psychological examples such as the calculation and interpretation of such questions and introduces students to basic univariate and bivariate statistics. It focuses on levels of measurement  and  the  appropriate interpretation of each statistic computed. Social and psychological examples are used for each application.

## SOCI1006: INTRODUCTION TO ANTHROPOLOGY

In this course students will learn about the discipline of anthropology, the scientific  study  of  human  diversity  and  similarity.  Although  it  focuses  on social/cultural anthropology, it will introduce students to the other subfields (archaeology, linguistic anthropology,  physical/biological anthropology). Students will explore some of the main themes that anthropologists have studied  over  the  years,  such  as  the  family,  'race,'  religion  and  language. More contemporary concerns such as migration, diaspora and globalisation will also be discussed.

In  addition  to  showing  what  anthropology  is,  the  course  will  show  how anthropology  is  done,  by  discussing  its  trademark  research  technique  of

ethnographic fieldwork and providing an opportunity for students to do their own  work  in  the  field.  It  will  also  discuss  career  opportunities  as  an anthropologist, both  in academia  and  in  such  fields as international development and public health.

## SOCI2000: CLASSICAL SOCIAL THEORY

The objective of this course is to bring the student to a deeper understanding and appreciation of the origins of sociological thought, and the ideas of the main  thinkers  during  the  formative  years  of  the  discipline.  It  explores different  concepts  and  definitions  and  expands  on  the  basic  information provided  of  the  classical  theories  in  the  introductory  course,  SOCI1002. Although  the  subject  matter  of  the  course  is  'classical'  it  is  taught  with references and example from 'real life', a down to earth sociology.

## SOCI2001: MODERN SOCIAL THEORY

A  sequel  to  SOCI2000,  this  course  is  designed  to  discuss  the  more  recent theoretical developments in theory. Beginning with the early 20 th Century theorists  it  continues  to  the  present,  where  it  explores  the  very  basis  of sociology today in the postmodern world.Like its predecessor, it emphasizes critical thought. A central issue is the fundamental relationship between the individual and society. The intention is for students to question and defend (if  necessary)  the  status  and  importance  of  sociological  analysis  today.  As with its precursor it is a down to earth sociology, taught with references and examples from 'real life'.

## SOCI2004: INTRODUCTION TO POPULATION

## SOCI2018:  ANTHROPOLOGY OF AFRICA

This course considers Africa from an anthropological perspective, covering 'traditional'  anthropological  themes  such  as  kinship,  religion  and  social organization. Importantly, the course rejects early anthropological studies of Africa that treat ethnic groups as static self-contained units, and considers them  as  dynamic  and  responsive  to  external  influences.  It  also  aims  to explore contemporary Africa through consideration of its colonial and postcolonial history. This course also takes a critical look at anthropology itself, by  attempting  to  locate  its  role  in  the  colonial  enterprise  and  in  the elucidation of notions of 'race.' The ultimateaim is to debunk popular and longstanding myths about Africa and blackness.

Various  conventions  of  the  ILO  will  be  analysed  both  internationally  and regionally relating to; freedom of association and the right to organize, equal enumeration, setting and monitoring labour standards and child and forced labour among others.  The current influence and power of international trade organizations and the impact and challenges they present to the development  of  Caribbean  economies,  will  form  part  of  the  discourse. Students  will  be  exposed  to  guest  lecturers  from  relevant  international organizations.

On completion of the course the students are expected to have knowledge of  how  the  international  trade  and  labour  standards  affect  the  region. Students should be able to discuss issues of development and their policy implications  for  the  Caribbean.  They  are  also  expected  to  offer  some solutions  and/or  policy  initiatives  to  the  region's  perennial  economic  and social problems caused by the hegemonic behaviour of international trade organizations in the Caribbean.

## SOCI3045: CAPSTONE COURSE IN SOCIAL POLICY AND DEVELOPMENT

The Social Policy and Development Major is built around the premise that students  should  gain  an  understanding  of  the  organic  links  between international forces, development  theories, social policies and social outcomes, and that this can be achieved by the application of the sociological

perspective to social problems and policy. This final year course will allow students  an  opportunity  to  synthesize  and  integrate  discrete  learning experiences gained throughout their degree programme.

Designed as a research activity, this year-long course (6 credits) provides a practical  experience  of  doing  applied  sociology.  Students  will  conduct primary  research  to  explore  a  social  issue  which  has  important  policy implications.    Students  will  meet  with  relevant  stakeholders  and  develop policy  recommendations.  The  course  utilizes  a  mixed  method  approach which  enables  students  to  strengthen  their  skills  in  both  qualitative  and quantitative  research  techniques  as  well  as  to  appreciate  the  benefits  of combining both approaches. Students will also be assigned specific readings that must be discussed in the seminars/group meetings that accompany this course.

## SOCI3046: THEORY AND PRACTICE OF RESTORATIVE JUSTICE I

This course looks at the history and the theory of Restorative Justice. We will also examine the techniques and practicalities of their concept in Jamaica. Restorative  Justice  is  both  a  theory  and  a  practice.  The  principles  are grounded in the practices of the ancient Mori Indians, First Nation and Native American tribes, and how they deal with offences committed within their colonies. We will then examine how the father of modern day Restorative Justice  has  used  the  principles  to  create  a  theory  and  the  guidelines  for practice  of  Restorative  Justice,  which  suits  modern  day  criminal  activities. The practice is structured on three pillars: Harms and Needs of the victim, Obligation of the offender and the engagement of all parties involved, which are victims, offenders and the community. The course will also delve into concepts that are important in understanding the role of the three pillars. Students will then be expected to research some element of the history and process, then demonstrate its applicability to modern day issues.

## SOCI3047: THEORY AND PRACTICE OF RESTORATIVE JUSTICE II

This  course  is  the  second  half  of  the  Restorative  Justice  course  and  is  a practicum. The students who wish to pursue this course are expected to have completed  SOCI3046  before  attempting  this  course.  The  objective  of  this course is to apply the theory and practices that you have gained from the prerequisite course and apply it to real-world situations, after brief training and  rehearsals.  Students  will  then  be  placed  in  an  institution  to  work alongside the Administration to apply the skills that they have acquired.

## SOWK2021: HUMAN BEHAVIOUR IN THE SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT

This  course  provides  a  comprehensive  examination  of  human  behaviour throughout the developmental lifespan and within different social settings from  the  unique  social  work  perspective  of  the  person-in-environment. General  systems/ecological  theory  provides  the  underpinnings  for  this approach from which the systems paradigm and model were developed as frameworks  for  classifying  other  theoretical  concepts,  assessing  social problems  and  for  devising  prevention  and  intervention  strategies  when working  with  clients.  Specific  attention  will  be  given  to  current  social problems in the Caribbean as they affect and are affected by various systems in the environment.

## SOWK 2022: HUMAN BEHAVIOUR IN THE SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT II

The  effects  of  the  macro  systems  on  the  clients  served  by  social  workers cannot be ignored. Culture, communities, institutions and organisations are the  primary  macro  systems  that  continuously  have  an  adverse  impact  on individuals  and  groups  within  the  social  environment.  Therefore,  it  is important that students have an understanding of the connections between the client's individual problems, and the larger social problems and macro level  change  efforts  required.  This  course  will  make  extensive  use  of  a political  economy  and  social  constructionist  perspective  in  theorising  the behaviour of small and large groups and organisations. Finally, students will examine  the  implications  of  this  knowledge  for  practice  in  the  Caribbean context.

## TOUR1000: INTRODUCTION TO TOURISM &amp; HOSPITALITY MANAGEMENT

This course presents a broad view of the hospitality industry. Learners will appreciate that the hospitality industry is not only about hotels, but that it also includes restaurants, private clubs, casinos and casino hotels, consulting firms, and cruise ships. Each segment of the industry offers numerous and diverse career opportunities

## TOUR2002: TRANSPORT AND TRAVEL

The  course  will  focus  on  the  dimensions  of  tourism;  historical,  economic, social,  cultural,  psychological  and  environmental  characteristics  as  they relate to the development of the travel and tourism industry with special emphasis on the transportation sector. Adequate transportation infrastructure and access to generating markets is one of the most important prerequisites for the development of any destination. Thus tourism travel and transport is a very active element of the tourist product and experience.

## TOUR3000: TOURISM MANAGEMENT

Tourism is a global phenomenon and in the Caribbean the tourism sector is the  main  stay  of  economic  success  for  several  Caribbean  countries.  This course therefore seeks to educate students on the intricacies of managing the tourism and hospitality industries. The course acknowledges the fact that tourism  management  is  not  confined  simply  to  supervision  within  the tourism  and  hospitality  setting.  Instead  the  course  focuses  on  the  major

functions, processes and procedures that are practiced and performed by the various areas associated with the tourism sector as a whole, as well as the management structure and functions of the tourism industry.

## TOUR3001: SUSTAINABLE TOURISM

The  concept  of  sustainable  tourism  will  be  fully  explored  with  the  use  of international, regional and national case examples. The supporting policy and planning mechanisms to achieve sustainable tourism in the Caribbean will be outlined.  Sustainable  tourism  is  designed  to  expose  the  student  to  the principles  of  sustainable  development  within  a  tourism  context.  Many Caribbean countries are dependent on the service industries in general and tourism  in particular as a means  of  ensuring  economic  growth  and development.  This  course  will  highlight  the  importance  of  tourism  in providing  economic,  socio-cultural  and  environmental  sustainability  for Caribbean economies.

## TOUR3004: DESTINATION MARKETING

As the recipient of tourism, the destination is a key element of the tourism system  and  provides  the  focal  point  for  tourism  activity  and  the  study  of tourism.  Since  tourism  is  consumed  where  it  is  produced,  the  destination comes under intense scrutiny and pressure from a wide range of sources, providing many challenges for all those involved in tourism in the public and private  sectors.  This  course  will  examine  the  key  issues  that  must  be considered  to  effectively  market  the  tourism  destination.  The  course evaluates:

- i. The factors that influence tourists' destination choices,
- ii. The  role  that  branding,  destination  image  and  promotion  play  in destination marketing,
- iii. The auditing and management of tourism destinations,
- iv. The  growing  importance  of  the  Internet  as  a  communications  and market development tool,
- v. Marketing destinations in crisis.

## TOUR3005: TOURISM PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT

At the end of this course, learners should have a better understanding of the importance  of  the  tourism  industry  to  many  economies,  especially  small economies within the Caribbean/CARICOM region. It is therefore necessary that workers and potential workers in this industry understand the planning and  organization  processes  of  the  industry  so  as  to  minimize  threats  and maximize opportunities. With the understanding that the essence of tourism involves  the  travel  to  places  and  the  interaction  with  people,  this  course focuses on the planning and organization of the 'People and Place' aspects of the four marketing P's and the policies and issues facing these entities.

## TOUR3007: DESTINATION MANAGEMENT

The course exposes students to issues surrounding the effective management of tourism  destinations.  The  course  focuses  on:  Destination development,  Issues  surrounding  destination  management,  Destination management policies, Tourism demand, the impacts of tourism, Destination sales and marketing issues, and Destination planning.

## TOUR3009: TOURIST BEHAVIOUR

This  course  will  be  based  on  the  already  existing  MGMT3070-Consumer Behaviour. The emphasis will now be on hospitality consumers in particular, with  a  view  to  understand  how  consumption  patterns  for  tourism  have changed with changing demographic factors. The changing consumer is a key area  which  must  be  understood  moving  forward;  as  there  are  increasing opportunities to introduce pull factors for various types of tourists. From an economic standpoint, some now view tourism as more than luxury goods which has implications for marketing efforts.

## TOUR3010: CARIBBEAN TOURISM

This  course  explores  the  many  aspects  of  tourism  in  a  Caribbean  context including the new and emerging challenges of sustaining a Caribbean tourism industry. There are broad issues that are addressed within the context of the proposed  Caribbean  tourism  guiding  policy  principles  for  sustainability, including capacity management, marketing, economic linkages, environment,  transport,  and  health,  safety  and  security.  Specific  topics addressed  include  inter-island  transport,  multi-destination  marketing  and organization to manage Caribbean tourism.

## TOUR3110: ECOTOURISM

This  course  examines  the  development  of  the  concept  of  ecotourism regionally and internationally. It takes students through the various components of Ecotourism, highlighting in particular, the business potential of the concept. Emphasis will be placed on understanding the relationship between  tourism,  society  and  the  environment,  and  the  effects  of  man's action  on  the  tourism  industry.  Ecotourism  will  be  examined  from  the perspective of its importance as a sustainable option for tourism development.

## FACULTY OF SOCIAL SCIENCES HONOURS SOCIETY

## Overview

Initially called The Dean's Breakfast Club, the Honours  Society was engendered by the Dean of the Faculty at that time, Barry Chevannes, to create a society for the Faculty's top-performing students. He conceptualized the Club as 'a potential training ground for a cadre of students who exemplify the Faculty's mission', one with on-going activities to not only nurture and enrich  its  members,  but  also  to  showcase  them  to  their  peers  so  as  to encourage  a  scholarly  culture  on  campus.  It  was  envisioned  that  after graduation,  the  Club  members  would  perhaps  be  the  most  important category of the Faculty's Alumni; and that contact would be maintained with these  prospective  graduate  students,  employees  and  future  lecturers/ researchers.

## Membership

Each year the most outstanding students who have demonstrated excellent performance in Level I or Level II (a cumulative level I GPA above of 3.6 or above)  of  their  BSc.  degree  are  inducted  into  the  Honours  Society  at  the Annual Breakfast Ceremony held in October each year.

Students would have met the other criteria of not having failed FOUN1013Critical  Reading  and  Writing  in  the  Social  Sciencesor  FOUN1019-Critical Reading and Writing in the Disciplines and not exceeding the maximum of one failed course (not including English). They join the members inducted from the previous year.

## Structure and Leadership

The Society is directly governed by an executive body in conjunction with the Dean.  The  five-member  executive  body  is  comprised  of  a  President,  Vice President, Treasurer, Public Relations Officer and a Secretary. At any time there should be at least two staff advisers assigned to the Society to help assist the executive body in directing the Society in fulfilling its purpose.

This code has been generated in line with what is believed to be staff and students'  general  perceptions  on  what  may  or  may  not  be  considered appropriate conduct, and has been formulated through constant consultation with representatives of the relevant groups. This has been done in  recognition  of  the  fact  that  the  faculty  and  its  environs  should  be associated  or  seen  as  being  synonymous  with  activities  that  uphold  the university's, and by extensions its faculties', mandate towards the expansion and promotion of pursuits of an academic nature; and that persons therein should aspire to conduct themselves in a manner that may be considered socially  acceptable.  Therefore,  wholesale  and/or  blatant  disregard  for  the stipulations made herein may result in the application of disciplinary action.

## Code of Conduct

- (a) Areas surrounding lecture rooms and offices are designated quiet zones. Students shall therefore refrain from engaging in loud conversation or any other noise-generating activity that may cause disturbance. This includes, but is not restricted to singing, recitations, preaching, loud praying, the use of noise-emitting electronic equipment (i.e. radios, phones, etc.), and romping and playing of physical games (e.g. scrimmage).

- (f) Persons, in adhering to this General Code of Conduct, shall also be careful to  abide  by  the  stipulations  of  other  such  Faculty  guidelines/policies. These include, but are not limited to the Faculty's Code of Conduct for Instructional Sessions, as well as the Faculty's Notice Posting Policy.

## GUIDELINES AND CODE OF CONDUCT FOR INSTRUCTIONAL SESSIONS

## Preamble

This Code has been established through a series of consultations between staff  and  students  and  approved  unanimously  by  the  Faculty  Board.  The University community is comprised of persons with varied backgrounds and who may have different norms for socially acceptable behaviour. Additionally changes occur over time in terms of technology, culture and the environment within which we exist. We must therefore continually review our relationship with each other so that we may operate harmoniously within the same space. The Code includes elements that are prescriptive while others are guidelines which the Faculty seeks to establish as normative behaviour.

## Code of Conduct

- (a) During the conduct of any class, there shall be no activity which disturbs the assembly and affects the order of the proceedings. Instructors have the right to require any student to leave the classroom if s/he is involved in disorderly conduct, or alternatively instructors have the right to leave the classroom themselves.
- (b) Cell  phones,  pagers  and  alarms  of  any  type  shall  be  turned  off  during classes. If there is an emergency for which a student or instructor may need to use the phone, this shall be indicated at/or just prior to the start of the class in a manner indicated by the instructor.
- (c) Entrance  and  Exit  doors  to  class  rooms  shall  be  used  as  designated. Students shall not enter the classroom prior to the end of the preceding lecture.
- (d) Children  are  only  allowed  in  classes  in  exceptional  circumstances  and instructors must be notified. Where a child begins to disturb the class, she or he must be immediately taken out of the room.
- (e) Garbage shall not be left in the classrooms.
- (e) Classes are to start 5 minutes after the hour and end 5 minutes before the hour  to  facilitate  students'  and  instructors'  attendance  at  consecutive classes  elsewhere.  Students  and  instructors  are  to  attend  and  leave classes punctually. Students who arrive late may be excluded from class. Faculty Guideline: Students may be excluded if they arrive 15 minutes or more after the time specified on the timetable.
- (g) All white/chalk boards or other instructional aids shall be cleaned/removed at the end of any class.

- (h) Students are to be given at least one days' notice where the schedule for a class is being changed and students are to be notified by the scheduled starting time where a class is expected to commence with a delay.
- (i) There  shall  be  no  eating  or  drinking  in  classes,  save  in  exceptional circumstances (e.g. students with diabetes or with classes from 11am to 2pm who are unable to eat during a break between classes). Students who find they must eat shall do so in a manner that ensures minimum disturbance to the class.
- (j) In dressing to come to class, students shall be conscious of their part of a community, the way others see them based on their deportment, the standards of dress recognized within various professional environments and the impact that their mode of dress may have on other members of the community.
- (k) Student representatives for each course are to be selected by the end of the fourth week of classes.

## ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF COURSE REPRESENTATIVES

- (a) The course representative, as elected by the students of a course, should be seen essentially as being responsible for representing the interests/concerns of his/her fellow classmates regarding the course to the lecturer/instructor.
- (b) He/She is responsible for maintaining an awareness of his/her classmates' concerns and/or feelings towards the course and will also be responsible for bringing them to the fore should such action be warranted.
- (c) He/She shall meet with the course lecturer/instructor on a regular basis, so that they may have a brief discussion regarding the course, where the course representative can make known to the lecturer whatever general concerns the students may have and vice versa. It is recommended that this be done at least once every three weeks.
- (d) He/She  shall  report  to  the  faculty's  student  representative  on  any pressing concerns that the students of the course may share, and on what consultation with the lecturer/instructor with respect to these concerns has yielded.
- (e) Should it become necessary to do so, he/she may, in consultation with the Faculty's student representative, bring such matters of concern to the attention of the Head of Department.
- (f) He/She should be prepared to make him/herself available to sit on the Departmental Staff/Student Liaison Committee, should such a request/ appointment be made.

## GUIDELINES FOR USE OF THE FACULTY OF SOCIAL SCIENCES MEETING POINT

- (a) The Faculty of Social Sciences Meeting Point has been created for the use of the students of the Faculty of Social Sciences.
- (b) The Faculty of Social Sciences Meeting Point has been established as a place where students from the Faculty can meet and engage in activities that are not necessarily of a strictly academic nature.
- (c) The Faculty of Social Sciences Meeting point has thus been developed as a space  where  students  can  gather  to  engage  in  informal  discussions, participate in quiet recreation and generally take a study break.
- (d) The growth of the Faculty has made this necessary as the increasingly large number of persons gathering within the Faculty has threatened to disturb the quiet atmosphere that is required for academic pursuits.
- (e) The Faculty of Social Sciences Meeting Point has been located close enough to the Faculty to allow students to easily move to and from classes while at the same time being sufficiently far away so as to avoid any disturbance to classes, offices and study areas.
- (f) Users are therefore requested to respect the purpose for which the Faculty of  Social  Sciences  Meeting  Point  has  been  created  and  to  maintain  its facilities in good order.

## GUIDELINES FOR USE OF ALL QUIET STUDY AREAS IN THE FACULTY OF SOCIAL SCIENCES

- (a) The clusters of benches within the Faculty were established several years ago to provide a space where students could engage in quiet study between classes.
- (b) A concerted effort is now being made to ensure that these clusters are used for  the  purpose  for  which  they  were  built.  All  users  are  therefore  being asked to assist in this effort.
- (c) At the same time, there is more to student life than classes and quiet study. In recognition of this a Faculty of Social Sciences Meeting Point has been created, half the way towards the Main Library, so as to provide a space for other types of activities.
- (d) Students who wish to engage in activities such as informal discussions, quiet recreation or who wish to take a study break are being asked to relocate to the Faculty of Social Sciences Meeting Point which has been developed to accommodate these pursuits.
- (e) The Space within the boundaries of the Faculty is primarily an academic space and must be protected as such. Thus, the culture that we construct within  these  boundaries  must  be  one  that  fosters  and  promotes  an ambience conducive to teaching, research and study.
- (f) In  recent  years,  some  of  the  clusters  of  benches  have  been  used  for purposes for which they were not intended. This has not helped to build the kind of atmosphere that is necessary for academic pursuits within the Faculty.
- (g) Some  activities  are  obviously  disturbing.  These  include  noisy  exchanges which can disrupt classes and prevent other persons from doing their work. Yet these are not the only activities that are of concern.
- (h) Simply put, the playing of games, discussions of a non-academic nature and the general meeting, greeting and chatting among friends and colleagues within the Faculty all tend to 'kill the study vibes'.
- (i) The Faculty supports a balanced student life and encourages wholesome recreation,  the  building  of  lifelong  friendships  and  the  lively  debate  of issues. At the same time, we must insist that there is a time and a place for everything.

## Appendix I: FSS MONA PHILOSOPHY OF TEACHING AND LEARNING

## Our Commitment

The  Faculty  of  Social  Sciences  identifies  'excellence  in  teaching'  as  a  key element of the UWI mission. The FSS is committed to facilitating its students and supporting its staff in line with the UWI's aim to produce a distinctive graduate (as the desired outcome of the teaching and learning process) with the set of attributes outlined in the 2012-2017 Strategic Plan and set out below 19 . In seeking to achieve its goals the FSS recognises the importance of monitoring and evaluating processes as the basis for on-going improvements in teaching and learning within the Faculty.

- · Critical and  creative  thinker  ·  Effective  communicator  ·  Good interpersonal skills · IT skilled and information literate · Innovative and entrepreneurial  ·  Globally  aware  and  grounded  in  his/her  regional identity · Socially, culturally and environmentally responsible · Guided by strong ethical values; with special emphasis placed on: · Leadership · Goal setting and · Ability to significantly contribute to new knowledge in the case of graduate students.

The  FSS  strives  to  create  an  environment,  which  fosters  self-reflective teaching and learning in which its staff members are committed to linking teaching  with  research,  participating  in  the  scholarship  of  teaching,  and adopting innovative methods that meet the full range of learning needs of a diverse student body. Teaching and learning is seen as a shared responsibility between students and teachers. This enhanced by the full integration of and cooperation  among  all  those  involved  as  instructors  within  a  collegial atmosphere that achieves an appropriate balance between the role of the individual instructor and that of the department, faculty and wider University community  including the specialized units such as the Instructional Development Unit, Students Services and Development, AQAC, the Deputy Principals Office and OBUS. The FSS is firm in its view that students must show  a  readiness  and  openness  to  learn,  be  active  in  the  teaching  and learning process, and take part in the assessment of the learning process.

The FSS sees itself as an integrated learning community which values both disciplinary  and  interdisciplinary  studies  and  encourages  students  to  take advantage  of  the  insights  and  skills  that  can  be  gained  from  a  range  of disciplines,  including  those  outside  of  the  faculty,  and  from  an  active participation  in  co-curricular  activities,  internships  and  other  enrichment opportunities.

## The Enablers

The  implementation  of  this  philosophy  is  dependent  on  a  shared  vision, adequate  infrastructure,  appropriate  workload  allocations  and  suitable requirements of and opportunities for instructional skills development, as well as a comprehensive set of administrative and academic support for staff and students. An effective recruitment process for instructors and students must be in place along with schemes for the professional development of staff; and students must be able to access effective counselling, academic advising and remedial services as needed. All instructors including part timers require adequate orientation and Heads of Departments must provide clear directions  regarding  teaching  expectations  to  new  recruits;  monitor  their progress  and  afford  them  mentoring  opportunities  where  appropriate. Students have different learning styles and strengths to which we must cater. We  must  identify  students  with  special  needs  (e.g.  social,  learning  and psychological) and pay attention to those who are doing poorly as well as those who are doing exceptionally well so that all groups may be supported to achieve their true potential. 20

## Quality Assurance

An integral element in the promotion of teaching and learning excellence in the FSS involves seeking to make the best use of the UWI quality assurance activities.  Quality  is  maintained  by  continuous  review  of  teaching  and learning strategies, programmes and courses - based on feedback, including that from institutional research; student assessments; peer reviews; external examiners' reports; departmental self-studies; analyses of international best practices and surveys of employers and graduates. Monitoring mechanisms, utilizing a user friendly format, have been designed to track the implementation of recommendations arising from quality assurance reviews along  with  any  alternative  approaches  designed  by  the  departments  in response to reviews. 21

## Teaching in Academic Staff Evaluation and Promotion

Teaching  performance  is  an  essential  domain  within  which  to  evaluate academics.  No  matter  the  excellence  in  the  other  domains  (1]  research, publications  and  scholarship  and  2]  contribution  to  University  life,  public service and professional activities) promotion must depend on meeting an agreed standard of quality in teaching. Colleagues are expected to draft their

own teaching philosophies and an assessment of teaching checklist is being developed to aid evaluation. 22

## Assessment of and for learning

There  must  be  a  clear  link  between  learning  outcomes,  stated  in  course outlines,  and  assessments  which  should  be  both  'of  learning'  and  'for learning'. The former evaluate the degree to which students have learnt and are  the  basis  for  final  grades.  The  latter  allow  for  feedback  to  benefit instructors and students as they seek to assess the extent of learning and adjust  instructional  and  study  strategies.  In  both  roles,  assessments  are pivotal  in  teaching  and  learning  and  therefore  require  the  attention  of Departments and the Faculty, which must ensure that instructors have the appropriate competencies and that responsibilities are shared in a collegial manner.

Assessments must be aligned within the context of programmes to ensure that those higher order skills associated with the attributes of the distinctive UWI graduate are tested utilizing a wide range of methods, within a system which  preserves  an  incontestable  reputation  of  probity  and  sanctions dishonesty. 23 Cross  cutting  curriculum  strategies  such  as  communicating across  the  curriculum  are  valued  and  every  effort  is  made  to  foster  the students'  sense  of enquiry, encourage  their  intellectual curiosity and promote autonomy, while directing them towards closer involvement with the evaluation of their learning, and that of their peers.

## Conclusion

We have a professional and civic responsibility to our Caribbean people to ensure that future leaders are equipped with tools necessary to secure the sustainable development of our region. To fulfil this responsibility, we must do all in our power to ensure that while pursuing their degrees within the Faculty, our students acquire the attributes of the distinctive UWI graduate, which will equip them to play their role as future leaders within (and beyond) the region.

## Appendix III:  Presenting and Documenting Material in Course Essays

Students often run into trouble when presenting and documenting material in course essays. The following guidelines should help students to steer clear of  any  of  the  pitfalls  that  might  result  in  being  penalised  for  breaching academic standards. Remember, it is your responsibility to ensure that your essays adhere to the standards of academic integrity.

## Types of Borrowed Material

There are three basic ways in which students may incorporate the ideas that they have confronted in their reading in their essays: quotation, summary and paraphrase. Far too many students misunderstand the differences between these.

## Quotation

With a quotation, you present another writer's idea in that writer's words. You must indicate the borrowing with either quotation marks or block indentation, combined with a footnote/endnote reference. For example: According to Stigler, 'every industry or occupation that has enough political power to utilize the state will seek to control entry. In addition, the regulatory policy will often be so fashioned as to retard the rate of growth of new firms.' 1

## Summary

A summary is where you present another writer's idea, only not his or her words; further, you present only the core of the idea-the main pointbecause you condense the idea as you reword it. You must also indicate the borrowing with a footnote/endnote, usually combined with an introduction (called a frame) that also attributes the summary.  Here is a summary of the sample quotation:

Stigler argues that influential economic interests seek regulations that reduce competition. 1

## Paraphrase

A paraphrase is like a summary in that you present only another writer's idea, not his exact words; this time, however, instead of compressing the idea, you restate it in your own words.  Thus, the paraphrase is a little like a translation. Although it isn't usually a word-for-word substitution, it often follows the pattern of the original wording. Again you must indicate the borrowing with a  footnote  or  endnote,  usually  combined  with  an  introduction  that  also attributes the paraphrase. Here is a paraphrase of the sample quotation from Stigler:

Stigler  says  that  economic  interests  with  sufficient  influence  over government  policy  will  try  to  bring  about  public  policies  that  deter

competition  from  other  firms.  They  will  also  encourage  rules  and regulations that are detrimental to new rivals. 1

All three types of presentation use borrowed ideas, but only a quotation uses borrowed words. You can mixanotherwriter'swords into your summary or paraphrase, but you must show the specific borrowing in quotationmarks . Here is our examplesummarywitha touch of quotation thrown in :

Stigler says that the economic interests with sufficient 'power to utilize the  state'  will  seek  regulation  that  operates  to  reduce  the  threat  of competition from potential rivals. 1

## Framing Your Presentation

Whether  you  quote, summarise,  or paraphrase, you must  give due attribution to your source, by framing the borrowed  idea with an introduction and a footnote/endnote. Your endnote must include a specific reference to the text from which you borrowed the material including page numbers. Keep in mind that, in the absence of a quotation, the reference in a footnote or endnote refers only to the single sentence that the notation follows. Of course, quotation marks or block indentations indicate the length of  a  quotation.  But  summaries  and  paraphrases  don't  have  such  ready mechanical  indicators.  However,  you  can  frame  a  borrowing  (especially  a summary or paraphrase) with an introduction and a footnote. An introduction like 'Stigler argues' or 'According to Christopher Hood, Stigler argues' will indicate the beginning of a borrowing, and the footnote/endnote reference will indicate the end. Then the footnote reference applies to the entire borrowing.

## Framing Hints

To work borrowed material into your papers, you must frame it gracefully as well  as  responsibly.  There  are  many  varied  ways  to  frame  a  quotation, paraphrase, or summary. Here is an example of the most common approach:

According to Stigler, 'every industry or occupation that has enough political power to utilize the state will seek to control entry. In addition, the regulatory policy  will  often  be  so  fashioned  as  to  retard  the  rate  of  growth  of  new firms.' 1

Don't  rely  solely  on  this  frame,  or  your  writing  will  seem  mechanical  and monotonous. Consider the alternatives below, and also note how the authors of your reading assignments frame their references to others.

## Variations on the 'According to' frame:

It  was  Mancur  Olson  who  first  pointed  out  that  'unless  the  number  of individuals is quite small, or unless there is coercion or some other special device  to  make  individuals  act  in  their  common  interest,  rational  selfinterested individuals  will  not  act  to  achieve  their  common  or  group interests. ' 1

In their article, 'Institutional Perspectives on Political Institutions', March and Olsen contrast the bargaining or exchange account of politics with an institutional  story  which  'characterizes  politics  in  a  more  integrative fashion, emphasizing the creation of identities and institutions as well as their structuring effect on political life.' 1

## The Interrupting Frame:

'Tales of monumental blunders, blatant self interest and corruption, selfdestructive  organizational  civil  wars  and  feuds,  astonishing  failures  to look ahead or take any initiative in the face of the most pressing problems are,' as Christopher Hood argues in The Art of the State, 'far from unusual in most societies.' 1

## The Separate-Sentence Frame:

'If bureaucrats are ordinary men, they will make most (not all) of their decisions in terms of what benefits them, not society as a whole.' 1 In these  terms,  Gordon  Tullock  makes  a  departure  from  the  orthodox assumption in public administration that public servants act in the public interest.

## Minor Errors-Format

On one end of the spectrum are minor errors in format. There are formats in all parts of life: don't eat peas with a knife; don't begin a bibliography entry with  an  author's  first  name.  For  those  who  ignore  formats,  punishments range from an admonishment to a deduction of a few points from a paper's grade.

## Major Errors-Plagiarism

At the opposite end of the trouble spectrum is plagiarism. Plagiarism involves presenting  someone  else's  words  or  ideas  without  giving  proper  credit. Therefore, you obviously plagiarize (a) if you present someone else's words as  though  they  were  your  own  (by  seeming  to  summarize  or  paraphrase when in fact you quote directly) or (b) if you present someone else's ideas without  giving  proper  credit  (by  failing  to  document  at  all).  Punishment depends  on  the  extent  of  the  offense.  But  you  should  realize  this:  any plagiarism violates academic integrity, so anything beyond the most minor, accidental plagiarism will usually result in a zero grade for a paper, with no chance to rewrite.

## Major Errors-Other

On the trouble spectrum between minor errors and plagiarism, there are other serious errors that can bring severe punishment. All of them breach academic integrity (making a zero grade possible) of them could be evidence of cheating. As with plagiarism, the extent of the error will determine the extent of the punishment.

## Blanket Notes

Remember that, except with quotations, a footnote or endnote generally covers  only  the  preceding  sentence.  The  old  student  standby  device  of putting a notation at the end of a paragraph to document something in the paragraph just won't work.  The problem could, of course, simply be sloppy presentation,  or  the  sloppiness  could  be  interpreted  as  an  attempt  to disguise cheating. Avoid the trouble by using the frame of introduction and parenthetical notation to indicate where a borrowing begins and ends.

## Wrongly Attributed Borrowing

You must attribute the material you borrow to the source you actually use. For example, you find in a book by Smith a quotation Smith borrowed from another book by Jones. If you use the Jones quotation, you must document the borrowing as material from Jones that you found in a book by Smith. You cannot, however, document the passage as if you had found it in the book by Jones or as if Smith himself had written it. Either of these ways misattributes the quotation, and you could be accused of deceiving your reader by claiming you'd read Jones' book.

## Padded Bibliographies

If you use a simple one-part bibliography, you must list only the works you actually cite in your paper. You cannot list other works you didn't cite but which you think the reader should be aware of. Listing works not cited in the paper  gives  the  appearance  that  you've  done  more  work  than  you  really have. So how can you show works that influenced you but that you didn't borrow  material  from?  Use  a  two-part  bibliography,  the  first  part  called 'Works Cited' and the second part called 'Works Consulted.' Their formats are the same.

## Appendix IX:    Sexual Harassment Prevention and Protection

The  University  of  the  West  Indies  (The  UWI)  is  an  equal  opportunity institution. Accordingly, sexual harassment, an aspect of gender discrimination  and  of  violence,  is  expressly  prohibited  and  will  not  be tolerated.  The  UWI  is  committed  to  ensuring  and  maintaining  a  safe  and healthy  educational  and  work  enviroment  which  is  free  from  sexual harassment.

The UWI will reflect this policy of non-tolerance of sexual harassment in the oversight of its students, employees, persons under its independent service arrangements, other persons who  provide academic  services to the University,  as  well  as  to  its  contractual  agreements,  independent  service arrangements and its inter-action with members of the public.

## What is Sexual Harassment?

According to the Sexual Harassment (Protection and Prevention) Act 2021, sexual harassment is defined as 'any conduct or behaviour that constitutes unwanted and unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature by one person toward another'.

## Types of Sexual Harassment

Sexual Harassment can take many forms - bothe verbal and non-verbal. Here are the main types:

- -Physical: Unwanted touching, hugging, kissing, groping, etc
- -Verbal:  Offensive comments about appearance, sexual jokes, insults based on sex. 'Compliments' can also be harassment.
- -Non-verbal: Suggestive gestures, winks, leering
- -Psychological:  Intimidation,  persistent  unwanted  advances,  sexual innuendo.
- -Cyber: Sharing sexual content or sending explicit messages via online platforms
- -Written/Visual: Distributing pornography or written sexual content
- -Quid Pro Quo: Trading sexual favours for job benefits or public services
- -Stalking: Obsessive following, contact, and watching someone, either physically or online
- -Voyeurism:  Spying  on  someone  in  a  private  space  without  their knowledge.

Remember, acts or comments of a sexual nature, not intended to harass, can constitute  sexual  harassment  if  another  person  feels  uncomfortable  with such subjects. Claiming to not understand or failing to know that an act is harassing, does not mean that it is not in fact, sexual harassment.

## Reporting Procedures

A sexual harassment complaint may be initiated via telephone, in-person (i.e. drop in/by appointment) or via a third party who was not directly involved with the sexual advance being reported. Communications about an incident (s) of sexual harassment can be informal (consultation) or formal (complaint) based on the wishes of the reporting party. All sexual harassment complaints shall be confidential. The procedures for each of these avenues are outlined in the Trauma - informed sexual harassment complaints protocol.

An abbreviated complaints procedure is provided here. Your Student Sexual Harassment  Peer  Advisor  (SSHPA),  Faculty  Sexual  Harassment  Focal  Point (SHFP) or the Sexual Harassment Complaints Coordinator (SHCC) in the Office of the  Campus  Registrar,  are  all  available  to  assist  you  in  making  a confidential complaint.

- 1. Complaint  received  by  Sexual  Harassment  Complaints  Coordinator; Student Peer Advisor; Staff Focal Point; walk-in; WhatsApp; Telephone
- 2. Sexual Harassment Complaints Coordinator informs complainant of the informal  and  formal  procedures  for  staff  and  students.  Respondent advised of the nature of the complaint with complainant's permission. Psychosocial support is offered.

## Filing Sexual Harassment Complaints

Any member of the University Community may make an allegation of sexual harassment to a Sexual Harassment Focal Point (SHFP), the Sexual Harassment  Complaints  Coordinator  (SHCC),  or  directly  to  the  Campus Registrar, stating that he or she believes that sexual harassment has occurred either against himself or herself or with respect to another member of the University  Community.  An  allegation  of  sexual  harassment  may  be  filed within  six years  of the  occurrence  of  the  alleged  incident  of  sexual harassment.

## False Sexual Harassment Complaints

A person who knowingly makes a false sexual harassment complaint to The University  may  be  subject  to  disciplinary  proceddings  in  accordance  with established University procedures for misconduct. A person who knowingly makes a false complaint before the Tribunal under Section 27 of the 2021 Act commits an offence. A person who contravenes subsection (1) commits an offence and shall, on summary conviction in a Parish Court, be liable to a fine not  exceeding  one  million  dollars  or,  in  default  of  payment  therof,  to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months.

## Appendix X: Online Learning Guide and Email Etiquette

'In many ways, effective communication begins with mutual respect, communication that inspires and encourages others to do their best.'

## Overview

Here in the Faculty of Social Sciences, UWI, Mona, we are proud to serve as role models for our students and to work with you as a team as we prepare you to become stellar graduates; the proud representatives of our brand as Social Scientists here at UWI, Mona.

While  we  feed  your  minds  with  various  academic  skills,  we  would  like  to ensure that we also help you in strengthening your skills by providing you with some important soft skills that are necessary to help you to achieve, personal, social and professional success. This document has been prepared to guide your etiquette in online settings, including your email etiquette.

## Online Learning Guide

Online learning has suddenly become our new way of operating. The months have gone by quickly since March 2020, and we now know that we need to adapt our expectations and behaviours to get the very best from our online experience.

Getting  the  best  online  learning  experience  means  taking  a  more  active approach,  such  as  being  prepared  to  speak  out  in  classes  and  tutorials, participate in discussions, and work collaboratively. Students who thrive in this new environment are self-directed, independent learners, who accept responsibility for organizing their learning.

Below are a few easy-to-follow rules to ensure you are making the best virtual impression and getting the most out of your online classes.

## 1. Be on time and ensure you are set up correctly.

Punctuality is especially important for online classes. Log into OurVLE at least five minutes before the start of the class, and locate Blackboard Collaborate (BbC). BbC is our virtual classroom solution that powers our online teaching. Check your microphone, and if it is your first online class, familiarize yourself with the interactive capabilities. Chat, polling, shared files, whiteboard, and other features can be accessed using the purple arrow icon in the bottom right corner of the page. Tools located at the top of the screen are participant controls to draw or write on whiteboards and/ or files. Please refer to the diagram  below.  Remember  too  that  running  other  applications  on  your computer can slow your connection to the session.

## 2. Try to be aware of your surroundings, especially if you are using your webcam.

While we understand that there are some things beyond your control, try as best as you can to find a space where there is nothing in the background (e.g., traffic, other people, a pile of laundry) that may distract from the class. Your Instructor and classmates can see behind you.

## 3. 'Mute' is your friend.

Once you log in to the virtual classroom, be sure to mute your microphone (lower left-hand corner). This will help to eliminate background noise that could  distract  the  class.  If,  for  any  reason,  you  forget  to  mute  your microphone, causing distraction, be quick to apologise once you realize.

## 4. Use the 'Raise hand' button and wait to be called upon.

If you wish to speak, please use the "Raise Hand" button at the center of the bottom of your screen. Once the Instructor calls on you, unmute yourself and begin speaking. When you have finished speaking, indicate you are done by saying  something  like  "That's  all"  or  "Thank  you"  and  then  mute  your microphone  again.  Please  lower  your  hand  once  you  have  made  your comment or your question has been answered.

## 5. Be Polite.

The  chat  feature  is  a  tool  to  make  comments  and  ask  questions  without interrupting the speaker but be aware that your comments are public and are recorded in the minutes of the session. Please take your posts seriously and review and edit your posts before sending. Avoid slang terms such as 'wassup?'  and  texting  abbreviations  such  as  'u'  instead  of  'you'.  Avoid using the caps lock feature AS IT CAN BE INTERPRETED AS SHOUTING. When communicating online, you should always treat your Instructor(s) and fellow classmates  with  respect.  Avoid  spamming  the  chat  or  sending  the  same message  repeatedly.  Keep  in  mind  that  the  chat  shows  the  more  recent messages;  a  student  who  sends  messages  in  the  chat  without  purpose drowns out the other students. Please remember, "You should always treat your Instructor(s) and fellow classmates with respect,'. Do not say online what you would not say in person.

## 6. Give your full, focused attention.

It goes without saying that giving your focused attention is one of the best things  you  can  do  to  learn  efficiently.  It  may  be  tempting  to  use  another device  or  engage  with  someone  or  something  else  in  your  surroundings rather than the class that you are a participant in. Side conversations with other  students  via  another  means  of  communication  should  be  avoided. Show respect  to  the  important  learning  process  that  you  are  engaged  in during the online class, just as you would if you were physically present in

person with your classmates. If you have to slip out of the class for a brief period, it is advisable that you indicate this in the chat, particularly if you are part of a small class or are expected to make a presentation during the class.

## 7. Participate fully.

Participating fully may look different depending on what your Instructor is expecting of you at any particular moment. At times, your Instructor will be leading the class in a discussion and this is when it is most important to speak up and share your thoughts. Of course, if your Instructor is simply sharing instructions with you, then participating fully means paying close attention to be sure you understand, writing anything down you do not want to forget, and  being  ready  to  ask  any  questions  you  have  about  confusing  sections when the Instructor is done.

Avoid the tendency of some students to sit back and observe. When there is a glowing screen in front of us, we can default to passive spectator mode. Even if it is just taking notes, make the most of each online class by becoming as  active  a  learner  as  you  can  be.  Remember  too  that  Lecturers  are  still required to be available for 'office hours', and that you may contact them via email for assistance with clarifying difficult material etc.

## 8. Review your notes and the recording later.

Recordings of the classes are generally available one hour after the online session.  It  may  be  helpful  to  some  students  to  use  their  notes  and  the recording  for  extra  review  of  concepts  that  might  have  been  difficult. Challenging  concepts  may  not  make  sense  on  the  first  time  through,  but reviewing the recording again the next day might clarify all your questions. Keep in mind that it is always possible that the recording will fail or there will be a glitch in the technology. It is a good idea to take notes during the live sessions and not only rely on re-watching later.

## 9. Keep up with all readings and assignments.

One  of  the  challenges  posed  by  online  learning  is  the  increased  level  of responsibility  that  students  will  have  for  their  own  learning.  It  can  be tempting to put off readings and assignments. Doing this once can have a spiral effect; you are likely to fall behind if you keep putting off readings and assignments.

Avoid  the  panic  and  the  feeling  of  constantly  being  behind  by  setting  up routines for yourself that ensure you are always on top of your assignments and readings. Adopt a mindset that each day you will review readings and focus  on  specific  assignments  and  learning.  Give  yourself  breaks  and  set micro-goals to ensure that you keep up the motivation.

## Email Etiquette

## Forms of address

The easiest way to address someone is to write 'Dear X'. 'Hi' is very colloquial and should not be used to address your Lecturer; it is

only appropriate between students.

## Titles

In the university context, there are three options: 'Mr./Mrs. Ms.', 'Dr.' and 'Prof'. You may write 'Dear Mr. Stevens'. There are some individuals who may not be sensitive to titles; in this case a formal approach is still required. You may write: 'Dear Michael Stevens'.

## Identifying yourself

Simply  use  your  first  and  surname:  'Samantha  Laws'.  If  you  know  your Lecturer well, you can use your first name. Do not assume that your Lecturer is aware of the course to which you refer. Indicate the class which you refer to as well.

## Identifying others

If you are referring to another student, 'my fellow student' or just the first name and surname of the person in question is appropriate. Reference to 'colleague' is only used in the professional setting.

## Before sending an email

-  Use clear and concise language. Be respective of the readers' time and attention.
-  Ensure that your writing is grammatically correct, spelling mistakes are eliminated and that the correct punctuation is used.
-  Avoid slang terms such as 'hiyee' or 'wassup?' and texting abbreviations such as 'u' instead of 'you'.
-  Limit and possibly avoid the use of emoticons. Not everyone knows how to interpret them.
-  Be cautious when using humour or sarcasm as tone is sometimes lost in an email or chat post and your message might be taken literally or offensively. That said, be careful of the tone of your email. This is a professional exchange. You may not wish to convey the impression of being clueless, irresponsible or rude.
-  Be sure to check that you are sending the message to the intended recipient before clicking the 'send button'. Also, if attachments

- are being sent, be sure to check that they are in place before clicking the 'send' button. Finally, be sure to check your course resources before asking the Lecturer questions, since the information may have already been shared with you on OurVLE or elsewhere.
-  Similarly, think before you send the e-mail to more than one recipient. Does everyone really need to see your message?

## Salutation

There  are  a  variety  of  ways  to  end  your  email.  Examples  include:  'Best wishes', 'Best regards', 'Yours truly', 'Yours faithfully', 'Yours sincerely' etc. Shortened forms have become common and are not considered impolite for example: 'Best, or Regards'.

## Timeframe for response

Lecturers get lots of emails; do not expect an instant response. Give two to three days for a response and if you do not hear from the Lecturer, just send the email again. The Lecturer may not have noticed it for several reasons. If you are sending an email while upset or angry, think about not sending it until you have cooled off. A 24-hour resting period is often a very good idea.

## Student-Lecturer Interactions

- 1. You are an adult: This environment is a supportive environment for you to learn to accept responsibility for the ways in which you act. Students are expected to conduct themselves in a mature manner.
- 2. All classes are important: Lecturers put a lot of time and effort into preparing for their classes. If you miss a class it is your responsibility to get the information you have missed, you can do so by consulting with your classmates, and completing the readings. If you are unclear about something, then you can consult your Lecturer. You should however be prepared before you go to your Lecturer. If you do consult your Lecturer be sure to indicate what you did to prepare to meet with them; this information will be appreciated.
- 3. Your GPA is your responsibility: Be consistent in reviewing your performance. Discuss any challenges that may be impacting your performance early in your courses. Follow up on your assignments and ascribed grades.
- 4. Be respectful: The University is an environment of mutual respect.

- 5. Grades are earned: You have to put in the time to earn the grades you deserve.  Do  not  argue  with  your  Lecturer  about  how  deserving  you  are. Rather, if you are concerned about your grade, you may take the following approach: 'I'm concerned about the grade I received. I expected it to be higher and  believed  I  followed  the  requirements.  May  we  discuss  exactly  what  I needed to have done differently?'"
- 6. Deadlines: Your Lecturer will give you adequate time to prepare for your assignments.  This  may  be  included  in  your  course  outlines,  posted  on OurVLE, and/or may be announced it class. It is your responsibility to follow these deadlines.
- 7. Investment in your studies: It is recommended that you review your notes before  and  after  your  lectures.  At  any  point  in  time,  your  Lecturer  may choose to give you a random quiz.
- 8. Be on time for your classes and tutorials: you cannot afford to miss the content of your courses, therefore it is expected that you will be on time for your lectures and your tutorials.
- 9. Missing lectures/tutorials: The University's regulation ( Student Handbook 2020-2021, p.39),  stipulates  that:  'All  registered  students  are  required  to attend prescribed lectures, practical classes, tutorials, or clinical instructions. Students with unsatisfactory class attendance [who have been absent from the  University  for  a  prolonged  period  during  the  teaching  of  a  particular course year for any reason other than illness] or who have failed to submit any assessments set by his/her Examiner, are subject to debarment by the relevant Academic Board, on the recommendation of the relevant Faculty Board,  from  taking  any  University  examination.  Procedures  to  be  used  to measure attendance and assessments shall be prescribed by the Faculty' (p. 39).
- 10. Cell phone usage in class : while in class, your cell phones should be on silent.

## Peer-Peer Interactions

Social  media  platforms  such  as  WhatsApp  and  Instagram  allow  for  rapid communication with friends, family and classmates, they also facilitate group participation through features that allow public access to discussion forums and posts. Below is a list of helpful suggestions that should allow seamless integration  and  navigation  throughout  group  chats  that  are  created  with academic intentions.

- 1. Keep the group chat relevant- Academic group chats have been created for the sole purpose of discussing pertinent information relating to a specific course and quickly disseminating updates from Lecturers regarding content and  deadlines.  If  your  intended  subject  of  discussion  deviates  from  the collective  academic  goal  of  the  course  or  if  a  message  only  relates  to  a specific person, it would be best advised to have such discussions in a private forum.
- 2.  Be  cautious  of  the  intentions  of  the  group  chats  with  which  you  are involved- group chats that are comprised of students who have examination questions and are copying answers to course work from peers SHOULD BE AVOIDED. This type of collaboration goes against the University's policy on academic integrity, it is your responsibility to ensure that you are mindful of the group chats you are involved in. Breaching your academic integrity results in serious sanctions.

If  you  notice  throughout  members'  interactions  that  there  is  evidence  of academic  dishonesty,  leave  the  group  immediately.  It  is  best  to  separate yourself from the situation as soon as possible. Find the appropriate group chat of students who are looking for genuine and acceptable assistance from their peers.

- 3. Be respectful of others- Do not start a group conversation at night when everyone is probably asleep. You may want to establish an appropriate time with the group. Use appropriate language for public conversation and when referring to other members of the group chat. Expletives have no place in communication with classmates.
- 4. Be very mindful of your tone-The common saying: 'It is not what you say, but how you say it', has even greater relevance in an online forum given our inability to interpret tone of voice in the messages that are sent. Stay clear of conversations that contain sensitive or controversial subjects, and as best as possible  avoid  conflict  or  escalating  tensions  through  rude  or  impulsive responses.  If  a  disagreement  ensues,  clearly  state  that  you  are  happy  to discuss the issue, but that a group chat is not the place. Then move to pick up the phone and have a conversation outside of the group chat setting.

- 5. Allow everyone an equal opportunity to participate in discussions or decisions that are relevant to the group.
- 6. Check messages for errors before pressing send- Under examination conditions, you are encouraged to check answers before turning them in; the same principle applies to group chats. Remember that you cannot take back your response once you hit send. Ensure that the message you send is the one you intended to send, before pressing send.
- 7. Be mindful when utilizing the services of class representatives- Each course normally has an assigned class representative whose main role is to advocate on  the  behalf  of  their  fellow  classmates  by  facilitating  communication between the Lecturer and students. While most class representatives eagerly have accepted the opportunity to act as a liaison, please be mindful that this is a voluntary position. They hold themselves to a particularly high standard and are willing to make every effort to ensure that students within the course are at ease, however they are not forced or compelled to meet individual demands. Approach class representatives  with  kindness  and  be  reminded that they too have lives of their own.

Let us work together on becoming aware of and harnessing these soft skills as they can help us to succeed in the classroom and better equip us to enter and thrive in the workplace after graduation.

## Appendix XI: FSS Community Appoints the Tiger as Mascot

The Faculty of Social Sciences is pleased to announce the appointment of the Tiger  as  the  Faculty  Mascot.  The  appointment  was  approved  by  the  FSS community through a survey of options.

It is not a coincidence that of all the options that were presented to members in our Faculty, the majority chose the Tiger as our mascot representative. On the surface, the choice of the Tiger may appear to be obvious, as the colours of  its  fur  (orange,  black  and  brown)  are  synonymous  with  the  Faculty's orange and black . The choice of the Tiger may have also been an unconscious calling,  which  delved  further  into  the  symbolic  meaning  of  the  Tiger.  It  is understood  that  this  specie  represents  strength,  courage,  determination, dignity  and  independence  -  a  replication  of  who  we  as  members  in  the Faculty of Social Sciences have been practicing for the last 60 years.

Although the year 2020 has brought some challenges and disruptions to our normal lives, it has also brought some unique opportunities. Unknowingly, we seemed to have been operating through our Tiger spirit, in that, we have been 'transforming our strong emotions' such as fear, confusion and anger, into  'wisdom'.  We  have  risen  above  several  challenges,  including  the pandemic and have come to the realization that not only can we manage courageously, but we can become better versions of ourselves.

'With the strength of the Tiger, we will move forward with Faculty pride and integrity,  while  harnessing  our  mental  and  physical  strengths.  Being  the 'powerful,  potent,  phenomenal  beings'  that  we  are,  we  will  lean  on, encourage and empower each other. Irrespective of the challenges that lie ahead, we know that we can find the 'will power' to overcome them.

FSS-Tigers/Tigresses, though the journey at times may be perceived as long and arduous, we continue to thrive, knowing that at times we will 'need to conserve on our energies' and 'choose wisely' how we will expend them today and beyond.

In 'silence and solitude', and free from 'any distractions', we must reflect on  our  past,  introspect,  and  stealthily  charge  into  the  future  with  new insights, inspirations, and goals.

FSS TIGERS! FSS TIGRESSES! 'Dis Yah Academic Year and Beyond Wi A Roll Wid It'
