## Procedural Guidelines for Examining PhD Theses

## GUIDELINES

The primary purpose of a PhD programme is to help candidates create new knowledge by conducting original research. To do this, candidates are expected to produce a thesis which demonstrates:

- a) Acquisition and interrogation of theoretical knowledge of their field of study.
- b) Development of a deep, critical understanding of methodological theory.
- c) Application of a) and b) in developing and conducting original research.
- d) Understanding of the theoretical and practical significance of the research findings.

## Descriptors for rubric

Attempted but Unacceptable:

Thesis includes this element, but it is not presented at the level expected at the doctoral level

Weak:

Quality of presentation barely meets standard of doctoral level work

Acceptable:

Quality of presentation meets minimum standard of doctoral level work

Good-Very Good:

Quality of presentation is quite high and above minimum standard of doctoral work

Excellent:

Quality of presentation is exemplary

NA (Not Applicable):

Please tick this column for indicators that are not evaluated in your discipline

If an indicator is deemed NA (Not Applicable) please pro rate the score awarded

Research problem is clearly

articulated, justified, and

relevant

Theories, concepts, models

are used appropriately to

ground the work
