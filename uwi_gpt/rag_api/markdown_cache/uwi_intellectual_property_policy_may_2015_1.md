## POLICY ON INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AND COMMERCIALISATION

## A. INTRODUCTION

The  primary functions of a University are teaching and research and the dissemination  of  the  results  of  such  research  for  the  public  good.    Those  Universities which are supported by public funds, such as The University of the West Indies, must also have as part of their mission the advancement of the public interest and the promotion of the economic and cultural development of the area which they serve.

Staff members  and  students  of  the  University  expand  the  body  of  general knowledge  and  enrich  the  educational  programme  of  the  University  through  research papers, articles, books, computer programs, films, inventions and other creations, in which intellectual  property  inheres.    Traditionally,  much  of  the  intellectual  output  of  the University is disseminated by publication and by placing it in the public domain.

The University affirms the principle of freedom of research and unrestricted dissemination of the information generated. It accepts that it is not a principal aim of the University to undertake research solely in anticipation of profit.  However, the University recognizes that significant financial benefits may be derived from the exploitation of products of creative activity in the University, especially in science and technology, engineering and agriculture.  Such exploitation must be undertaken within a framework which fairly safeguards both the interests of the individuals who create the intellectual property in these products as well as the interests of the University.

Further, the University is aware of the need to provide guidance on the appropriate use of the University's name, Coat of Arms and other University trade marks, so as to safeguard the institution's brand.

Therefore,  within  the  context  of  the  intellectual  property  law  regimes  of  the countries  served  by  the  University,  this  Policy  sets  out  the  principles  governing  the ownership and disposition  of  intellectual  property  generated  within  the  University,  the respective rights and responsibilities of those involved and the administrative arrangements for the management of intellectual property in the University. The Policy

also  provides  guidance  on  the  commercialisation  of  intellectual  property  developed within the University and on the use of University-owned trade marks.

## B. PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF POLICY

## Purpose

This Policy is designed for the following main purposes:

- (a) to provide a framework which will stimulate and facilitate staff members and students to undertake research and to protect and exploit potentially valuable research results;
- (b) to establish a proper basis for the transfer of technology from the University to the wider community and the generation of income derived from the commercialisation of intellectual property rights owned by the University;
- (c) to encourage and develop institutional growth through the commercial application of research results and through ventures with industry and commerce;
- (d) to  ensure  that  the  rights  and  interests  of  all  parties  concerned  are  fairly determined  with  full  regard  for  the  proper  role  of  the  University  and  the principles of academic freedom;
- (e) to provide guidelines on the use of trade marks owned by the University;
- (f) to  make  provision  for  the  proper  administration  of  intellectual  property rights within the University.

## Scope

This Policy covers copyrightable materials, inventions, trade marks and plant varieties.  It has effect in relation to University activities in all countries served by the University and applies to all faculties, departments, schools, centres, institutes and other academic and administrative units of the University.

The Policy extends to staff members of the University including such staff members on sabbatical leave, and also to scholars visiting from another university or research facility, except in so far as its application is precluded by the policies of the host institution of a

staff member on sabbatical or, as the case may be, by the institution to which the visiting scholar is employed, and the University has agreed to different arrangements.

Students who are also employees of the University shall be treated under the Policy as staff members in connection with activities related to their employment.  Students who hold awards (e.g. scholarships and fellowships) through the University in respect of which the funding body has placed restrictions on the proprietary rights in items developed under and during the course of the award, shall be treated under this Policy in the same manner as students working on sponsored research or other agreements.

This  Policy  operates  in  the  context  of  applicable  laws  of  the  countries  served  by  the University.    Interpretation  of  the  Policy  in  relation  to  any  matter  arising  in  any  such country will be in accordance with its relevant laws.

## C. INTERPRETATION

## PART 1: COPYRIGHT

## 1.0 Introduction

- 1.1 Copyright is a property right which the law gives to creators of literary works (including scholarly and scientific papers and examination questions) dramatic, musical and artistic works, databases, photographs, computer programs, films, broadcasts, cable  programmes and the typographically arrangement of published editions.  For a work to enjoy copyright protection it must be original, in the sense that it should not be a mere copy of another work and, in addition, it must be recorded in a tangible form.  Certain prescribed requirements must be satisfied relating to the nationality or habitual residence of the author or the place of first

publication of the work.  Copyright protection of a work is not dependent on registration or other formality.  The owner of copyright in a work is given the exclusive right for a specified time to exploit the work, subject to prescribed exceptions.

- 1.2 This Part of the Policy establishes the respective rights of the University, its staff members  and  students  in  relation  to  the  ownership  and  disposition  of  rights  in works generated within the University that are protected by copyright.
- 1.3 In its application, the Policy is subject to the relevant laws governing copyright in Contributing Countries.

## 2.0 Ownership of Copyright

- 2.1 Under the copyright laws of Contributing Countries, the general rule is that the creator of a work is the first owner of copyright in the work, unless a contrary arrangement is made.  By way of exception to this principle, some laws give to an employer an automatic ownership of copyright in a work created under a contract of employment, unless there is an agreement to the contrary.  In such countries, this Policy can be considered such an agreement by which the University will reassign copyright ownership to staff members, except in the specific instances indicated below in paragraph 2.4.
- 2.2 This Policy maintains the traditional relationship between the University and staff members who are  authors  of  scholarly  and  artistic  works,  whereby  copyright  in textbooks,  monographs,  papers,  lecture  notes,  unpublished  manuscripts,  slides, musical compositions, works of art, and similar material, are the exclusive property of  the  staff  member,  except  where  they  are  produced  as  part  of  a  sponsored programme or  other  agreement  or  where  the  University  claims  ownership  under this Policy.
- 2.3 A staff  member  who  owns  copyright  in  a  work  has  the  full  responsibilities  and exclusive  rights  of  ownership,  including  the  full  enjoyment  of  any  royalties accruing from the exploitation of the work. However -

- (a) if,  during  the  preparation  of  the  work  by  the  staff  member  the University  incurs  some  incremental  costs  (for  example,  overtime typing costs,  hiring  of  extra  secretarial  help,  cost  of  tapes,  film  or other expendable  materials) such costs shall be recovered as provided in paragraph 4.1; and
- (b) in recognition of the general resources and facilities provided by the University,

the staff member shall grant the University a royalty-free right to reproduce and use the work within the University.

- 2.4 The University owns copyright in a work in the following cases, unless another  arrangement  to  the  contrary  was  made  in  writing  before  the  work  was undertaken -
- (a) where the University specifically asks or directs a staff member to undertake the work; and
- (b) where  the  University  employs  staff  for  the  express  purpose  of creating or producing works which may be eligible for copyright or where there is an explicit requirement in a job description for this responsibility (e.g. editors, film makers, media producers).

In such cases, the professional interest of the staff member and the reputation of the University require that there be adequate mutual control over the use of such work. The  extent  of  such  control  and  mutual  rights  with  respect  to  the  revision, withdrawal,  limitation  and  termination  of  use  of  such  work  shall  be  agreed  in writing between the University and the staff member  before  the work  is undertaken.

- 2.5 The University may allow the staff member or members who created work in which the University claims proprietary rights to share in any royalties that accrue from the sale or lease of the work outside the University, provided an appropriate agreement was entered into before the work was undertaken.
- 2.6 Where a staff member develops a work in the course of or pursuant to a sponsored research  or  other  agreement,  ownership  of  the  copyright  in  the  work  shall  be determined  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  the  sponsored  research  or  other

agreement.    The  University  reserves  the  sole  right  to  make  agreements  with sponsoring organisations and to include therein such provisions as to the ownership and disposition of copyright as it thinks appropriate.  However, the University will not, without the consent of the staff member who is the author, make agreements which affect the staff member's copyright in any work.

- 2.7 Where, pursuant to this Policy, the University claims part-ownership in any work, the  University  and  the  staff  member  who  is  the  author,  by  agreement,  will  each assign and transfer to the other the right to acquire and use copies of the work at the cost of reproduction, without payment of fee or royalty.  The agreement between the  University  and  the  staff  member  will  continue  after  the  staff  member's employment with the University is terminated, unless an arrangement is made to the  contrary.    Access  to  the  work  by  third  parties  shall  be  subject  of  a  specific agreement between the University and the staff member.

2.8

2.9

Where  a  student  produces  a  work  based  on  research  or  other  scholarly  activity conducted under the supervision of a staff member and the supervision of that work is a requirement of the student's academic programme, then, the University will not claim  proprietary  rights  in  the  work  except  in  the  circumstances  described  in paragraph 2.10.

Where a  student  has  proprietary  rights  in  a  work,  the  University  shall  receive  a non-exclusive, royalty-free licence

to -:

- (a) make copies or representations of the work for academic purposes within the University;
- (b) circulate the work as part of the University library collection;
- (c) at the request of other Universities or of other institutions approved by the University, make single copies of a thesis deposited in the University library;
- (d)         make available the work to the National Library of a Contributing Country;
- (e) publish an abstract of any work that is a student thesis.

- 2.10 The University may claim proprietary rights in a work produced by a student where -
- (a) the staff involvement in the creation of the work is substantial and the University desires to exercise its rights based on this involvement; or
- (b) the work is part of a larger work over which the University intends to exercise its rights; or
- (c) the use  of  the facilities, equipment  or  other  resources  of  the University  are  substantially  in  excess  of  the  norm  for  educational purposes.

The properly authorised use by students of computers, facilities, equipment or other University  resources  or  the  use  of  University  libraries  to  create  works  shall  not constitute a basis for a claim by the University of proprietary rights in such works.

## 3.0 Distribution of Income Generated from the Exploitation of Copyright

- 3.1 Where the University claims ownership of copyright in any work, the University will make an income agreement with the staff member or student who created the work.  The income received is to be used first to meet all marketing costs and any costs associated with the protection or defence of the copyright, and also to repay any funds specifically advanced for the project by the University.
- 3.2 The agreement on distribution of further income will be based on the following guidelines:
- (a) until all preparation or development costs incurred by the University are recovered, the staff member or student will receive 25% and the University 75% of this income;
- (b) once all preparation or development costs have been recovered, the staff member or student will receive 75% and the University 25% of this income;
- (c) if more than one staff member or student is involved, the available income will be distributed among them in accordance with a prearranged and agreed distribution ratio.

## 4.0 Recovery of University Costs

- 4.1 Where the copyright in a work belongs to a staff member but the work was produced with the use of University facilities, which in the opinion of the Head of Department, exceeds those available for normal academic and administrative matters, the University, including the  Department,  expects  to  recover  its  financial  input  in  the  work.    Accordingly,  the University and the staff member will agree to either:
- (a) reimbursement  of  the  University  to  the  extent  of  the  identifiable  costs incurred in the preparation and production of the work; or
- (b) distribution of royalties as indicated in paragraph 3.2 above.

## 5.0 Allocation of University Royalties and Fees

- 5.1 Royalties, or other income from the exploitation of copyright, accruing to the University in excess of the amount necessary to meet the costs specified in paragraph 3.1 will normally be made available for the enhancement and development of academic research programmes and resources.

## 6.0 Infringement of Copyright

- 6.1 The  University  Community  is  reminded  that  the  copyright  legislation  of  all Contributing  Countries  is  specific  with  respect  to  infringement  of  copyright. Copyright is infringed by any person who, without consent, does anything that only the copyright owner has the right to do.  Infringement may occur, for example, in the reproduction in any form of a work protected by copyright or the duplication of protected sound recordings and computer programs, unless the act falls within an exception to the infringement of copyright specified in the copyright legislation of the relevant Contributing Country or is covered by a licensing arrangement made between the University and an organisation representing the copyright owner. The Designated  Office  will  provide  information  on  the  permitted  uses  of  copyright material under any such licensing arrangements.

## PART II: INVENTIONS

## 1.0 Introduction

- 1.1 This Part of the Policy defines and establishes the respective rights and obligations of the University, its staff members and students, in relation to inventions resulting from research or other activities conducted by them.  A basic principle underlying the  Policy  is  that  all  parties,  including  students,  who  have  made  a  significant contribution  to  an  invention,  should  receive  a  fair  share  of  the  benefits  derived from  it.    The  Policy  is  intended  to  provide  the  framework  for  identifying  those inventions  that  are  capable  of  profitable  exploitation  and,  where  appropriate,  to obtain  protection  for  them  whether  by  way  of  patents  or  by  some  other  form  of protection.
- 1.2 In  its  application,  the  Policy  is  subject  to  the  relevant  laws  in  Contributing Countries governing patents.
- 1.3 To be patentable an invention, which may be a process or product, must (a) be new; b)  involve  an  inventive  step,  that  is,  a  step  not  obvious  to  anyone  skilled  in  the subject; and (c) be capable of industrial application.
- 1.4 A patent gives the patentee the exclusive right to use and exploit the invention for a specified time, subject  to  prescribed  statutory  exceptions.    The  patenting  process can be long and expensive and is not worthwhile unless the invention has a strong chance of being developed and marketed.  Inventions that are not patentable or in respect  of which  a  patent  application  is  not  pursued  may,  nevertheless,  be profitable through licensing and other arrangements with industry.
- 1.5 The success of the Policy depends on the awareness of staff members and students of the issues involved, their bringing the invention to the University's attention at an early stage and co-operating to ensure that the interests of the staff member, or, as  the  case  may  be,  the  student,  the  University  and,  where  applicable,  outside sponsors, are not jeopardised.

## 2.0 Ownership of Inventions

- 2.1 The rights and obligations of the University, staff members and students may be defined in terms of the following categories:

- A. Inventions  made  by  staff  members  or  students  in  the  course  of demonstrably private research, in the case of staff members, unrelated  to  their  normal  University  duties  and  in  the  case  of students, unrelated to their programmes of study, and which do not involve any significant use of funds, space or facilities administered by the University;
- B. Inventions made -
- (a) by  staff  members  in  the  course  of  their  normal  duties  at  the University  or  by  students  in  the  course  of    programmes  of study at the University; or
- (b) by staff members or students  involving the significant use of space, funds or other facilities administered by the University;
- C. Inventions made by staff members or students which are subject to the  terms  of  a  sponsored  research  or  other  agreement  between  the University and a third party.
- 2.2 Inventions made in the course of demonstrably private research and not involving the significant use of funds, space and facilities administered by the University are wholly  the  property  of  the  staff  member  or  student.    The  University  will  not construe  the  payment  of  salary  to  a  staff  member  from  general  funds  or  the provision of office or library facilities as constituting significant use of University funds, space or facilities.
- 2.3 Where an invention falls within the category referred to in paragraph 2.2 the staff member or student may, under terms of agreement with the University, (a) submit the  invention  to  the  University  for  the  purpose  of  obtaining  a  patent  or  for  its commercial  exploitation  and  management;  or  (b)  request  that  the  invention  be appraised by and, if appropriate, assigned to the University. The University shall not be obliged to accept the invention and, if it accepts the invention for review, may decide that it is not in the best interests of the University to exploit or manage the invention or to take an assignment.
- 2.4 Inventions which are made by a staff member within or partially within the staff member's normal field of activities or employment responsibilities or involving the

significant use of space, funds or other facilities administered by the University, or by a student in the course of a programme of study at the University shall be the property of the University.  If the University undertakes patenting and commercial development and exploitation of the invention, the staff member or student shall receive  a  share  of  the  net  income  generated  by  the  invention,  as  set  out  in paragraph 3.

- 2.5 Staff members who are also part-time students shall be considered staff members as regards the ownership and disposition of inventions.
- 2.6 Inventions which are made by staff members or students under sponsored research or other agreements are governed by the terms of those agreements.
- 2.7 Where, in relation to inventions falling within categories B and C of paragraph 2.1, one or more individuals from outside the University are co-inventors with a staff member or student, if the invention is owned in part by an outside sponsor, then the University will share in the ownership of the invention to the extent determined by negotiation between the Pro Vice Chancellor and the outside inventor or sponsor.

## 3.0 Distribution of Royalties and Fees

- 3.1 Where  an  invention  (whether  patentable  or  not)  is  exploited  by  the  University directly or in partnership with others, the University agrees in normal cases to pay the staff members or students who made the invention such sums as shall ensure that  the  University  and  the  staff  members  or  students  shall  each  obtain  mutually acceptable shares of the benefit derived from the invention, having regard to all the circumstances of the case.  Such share shall be governed, for the time being, by the following formula -

To the inventor(s)

- 50 % of net income

To the originating department

or Institute To the originating Campus

- 20% of net income

- 15% of net income

To the University or its

Assignee

- 15% of net income

- 3.2. In paragraph 3.1 "net income" means the amount remaining after documented direct assignable expenses incurred in connection with an invention and an amount to cover overhead expenses (not exceeding 15% of the direct assignable expenses) are deducted from the gross income derived from that invention; and for the purpose of this definition-
- (a) "direct assignable expenses" includes expenses connected with patent filings, patent prosecution and defence and maintenance fees and specific marketing costs; and
- (b) 'gross income" means all royalties, payments or benefits actually received in relation to a disclosed invention.
- 3.3 Although the provisions specified in paragraph 3.1 shall normally apply, the Bursar may draw to the attention of the Pro Vice Chancellor any special cases and, in particular, any
- case where the income is likely to be substantial.
- 3.4 Where  two  or  more  staff  members  or  two  or  more  students  made  the  exploited invention,  each  of  them  shall  share  equally  in  the  inventor's  share  of  the  net income,  unless  all  of  them  have  previously  agreed  in  writing  to  a  different distribution of such share.
- In  the  event  of  any  litigation,  actual  or  imminent  or  any  other  action  to  protect patent rights or other proprietary rights, the University may withhold distribution of
- 3.5 all royalty income until the resolution of the matter.

3.6

- Funds received in accordance with this Policy by a Department or Campus or by the University shall be used for administrative purposes with special emphasis on research and scholarly activities.
- 3.7 Where a patent is obtained for an invention, then, subject to paragraph 3.8, the right of an inventor to receive income under this Policy shall extend for the term of the patent and any renewals thereof and such right may be assigned or bequeathed by the inventor.
- 3.8 Each  inventor  is  required  to  keep  the  Designated  Office  informed  of  his  or  her current home address, as royalty income will be sent to that address.  The Office

will make reasonable efforts to trace the whereabouts of an inventor for whom a current  address  is  not  available.  However,  royalties  that  remain  unclaimed  for twenty four months after the first notification of the payment of royalties sent to the address  last  furnished  by  the  inventor  will  be  re-invested  in  commercialisation activities at the Campus on which the inventor was employed or was a registered student (as the case may be) when the invention was developed.

## 4.0 Invention Disclosure

- 4.1 A staff member or student who has made an invention must disclose it promptly in writing to the Designated Office using the Invention Disclosure Form available from that Office. (See the Website of the Office).
- Where  necessary,  assistance  in  completing  the  form  will  be  provided  by  that Office.
- 4.2 The  staff  member  or  student  shall  not  file  or  permit  others  to  file  a  patent application in the name of such member or student without providing at least 30 days'  notice,  in  writing,  to  the  Pro  Vice  Chancellor  and  a  statement  of  the circumstances in which the invention was developed.  The staff member or student shall,  if  requested  to  do  so,  provide  a  copy  of  the  Invention  Disclosure  Form  or proposed patent application.
- 4.3 It is important that this initial contact is made as soon as possible and that no steps are taken to place the invention in the public domain by a lecture or publication until the invention has been reported to and discussed with the head of the Designated Office.
- 4.4 The Form should be submitted to the head of the Designated Office (copied to the Pro-Vice Chancellor) who will request the sub-Committee to investigate, as soon as  possible,  the  patenting  (or  other  means  of  protection)  and  marketing  of  the invention, unless the Form is accompanied by a letter requesting other action by the University,  such  as  a  waiver  by  the  University  of  its  rights  of  ownership  in  the invention.

## 5.0 Responsibility of University in relation to Invention Disclosure

- 5.1 . Within 30 days of the date of submission of a duly completed Invention Disclosure Form, the head of the Designated Office must convene or cause to be convened a meeting of the sub-Committee.  The Head of Department in which the invention originated, the Dean of the relevant Faculty and the inventor or inventors will be invited to attend.  In order to assist its deliberations in any particular case, the subCommittee  may  use  a  variety  of  tools,  including  Web  searches  and  proprietary databases,  and  may  co-opt  such  financial,  technical  and  legal  experts  as  may reasonably be required in order that a thorough assessment of the technology may be made.
- 5.2 Using  the  information  supplied  by  the  staff  member  or  student  in  the  Invention Disclosure Form, the sub-Committee will determine whether the invention and any related proprietary rights are owned solely by the University, the staff member or student  or  an  outside  sponsor,  or  is  jointly  owned  by  the  University  and  a  staff member,  student,  an  outside  sponsor  or  some  other  person  or  body.    The  subCommittee will also determine the identity of all co-inventors.
- 5.3 . The sub-Committee must also: a) enquire into the marketability of the invention and make a recommendation as to whether it should be commercialised; b) express an opinion as to whether the invention appears to meet the criteria for patentability; and  c)  make  a  recommendation  as  to  whether  the  University  should  seek  patent protection  for  the  invention.  Discussions  may  also  be  held  with  industry  contacts under confidentiality agreements, where necessary.

5.4

5.5

- Where  the  results  of  an  evaluation  indicate  that  a  technology  needs  further development, prototyping or proof of concept before it is ready for patenting, it will be  referred  back  to  the  inventor(s),  and  commercialisation  efforts  will  be  put  on hold until further data can be generated and the details of the invention expanded. The Designated Office will assist in identifying funds for further development.
- Within  5  working  days  of  the  conclusion  of  its  deliberations  on  the  matters specified in  paragraphs  5.2,  5.3  and  5.4,  the  head  of  the  Designated  Office  shall provide the Pro Vice Chancellor with a report on the findings and recommendations of the sub-Committee.

5.6

5.7

5.8

5.9

5.10

If the University owns the invention, the Pro Vice Chancellor, on the recommendation of the sub-Committee, and taking into account the provisions of paragraph 5.13, will decide within 90 days of the date of disclosure: a) whether or not the University will proceed with the commercial exploitation of the invention and,  if  so,  the  most  appropriate  means;  and  b)  if  a  patent  application  should  be filed.    Before  making  a  decision  the  Pro  Vice  Chancellor  may,  in  any  particular case,  request  that  a  more  extensive  assessment  be  undertaken  to  confirm  the patentability and/or commercial potential of the invention.

If the University owns the invention and decides to proceed with the commercial exploitation of the invention, the staff member and/or student will assign in writing to the University all rights to that invention using the appropriate form.  The Designated Office is responsible for ensuring that the assignment is effected.

If the University does not wish to proceed with the commercial exploitation of the invention, then, at its discretion, it may: a) on request, assign in writing to the staff member or student all rights to the invention, but will retain a royalty-free licence to  use  the  invention  in  its  teaching  and  research  programmes;  or  b)  release  the invention to the public domain.

If the decision is that the invention is owned by the staff member or student, the Pro Vice Chancellor or the head of the Designated Office on behalf of the Pro Vice Chancellor, will so advise the staff member or student in writing.  The staff member or student is then free to commercialise the invention privately or may offer it to the University for exploitation or appraisal as provided in paragraph 2.3. If the University is a joint owner of an invention with a person or persons outside the University, the Pro Vice Chancellor or designee will undertake discussions with the other joint owners with a view to determining the appropriate route for commercial exploitation.

5.11 If the invention is owned by a sponsor or outside client, the Pro Vice Chancellor or the head of the Designated Office on behalf of the Pro Vice Chancellor, will notify the sponsor or client and take whatever action is appropriate under the terms of the agreement between the sponsor or client and the University.

- 5.12 Inventors of an invention for which a patent application is filed shall co-operate, without expense to the inventors, in the patenting process in all ways required by the University, its agent or designate.
- 5.13 The University will not normally file a patent application for an invention unless it has decided to proceed with the commercial exploitation of the invention.  Early in the evaluation process, the University will seek to secure options to license the invention and will explore such other contractual arrangements for its exploitation as may be appropriate in the circumstances.

## 6. 0 Commercialisation of UWI Inventions

- 6. 1 Commercialisation of an invention owned by the University may, without limitation, be by way of (i) assignment for consideration (i.e. sale) ; (ii) licensing for consideration or (iii) equity participation in a spin-off company.
- 6.2 Where commercialisation is by means of licensing, the   University will normally grant non-exclusive royalty-bearing licences to all qualified licensees.  However, given that in some cases, non-exclusive licensing may not be effective in bringing an invention to the commercial market in a satisfactory manner, the University may grant an exclusive licence to an invention, where it determines that this is required in the public interest to encourage the marketing and public use of the invention. An entity that is granted an exclusive licence to develop or commercialise a University - owned invention that is patentable shall be required to reimburse or bear all the expenses incurred in obtaining the licensed patents(s).
- 6.3 In all licensing arrangements for an invention owned by the University -
- (a) the University shall reserve to itself a right to make or have made and to use the invention within the University for its own educational and/or  research purposes;
- (b) royalty rates will be reasonable and consistent with the goal of the University to transfer technology effectively in the public interest;
- (c) the licence must generally include provisions covering non-refundable licence fees, patent expense reimbursement, royalties and minimum royalty

payments,  a requirement of diligence, the cessation of licensing rights and the termination of the arrangement, should the licensee fail to develop and market the product within a reasonable time;

- (d) the University, its staff members and students should be protected and indemnified from all liability arising from the development, marketing or use of the invention or related proprietary  rights;
- (e) the licensing process shall not restrict the publication rights of the inventor(s);
- (f) commitments should not be made for future University  inventions even when improvements are expected.  However, the Designated Office may make exceptions occasionally, as appropriate, including without limitation, to handle subordinate patents and well-defined derivative works for software;
- (g) the University shall have the right to receive or examine accounting records maintained by the licensee and any sub-licensee.
- 6.4 Only the Pro Vice Chancellor or the Principal of a Campus or a person authorised by either of them may assign or license rights in an invention to a third party: no one else has the authority to do so. It is incumbent upon all members of the University community to ensure that no language purporting to assign or license any proprietary rights owned by the University is included in any agreement that they sign.
- 6.5 An invention owned by the University, although unpatentable for various reasons, may still contain confidential proprietary information of commercial significance, for example, technical know-how and trade secrets.  Rights in confidential proprietary information may be licensed, and such information should be included in the Invention Disclosure Form required to be completed under paragraph 4.1.
- 6.6 The head of the Designated Office shall ensure that licensees of University-owned inventions fulfil the promises they made in their licence agreements with the University, especially those relating to obligations for diligently developing products based on the licensed technology and for paying royalties and other fees that come due under the licence.

- 6.7 The officer in the Designated Office who is assigned responsibility for the administration of a licence agreement (the licensing officer) must keep in contact with the licensee after the execution of the licence agreement, facilitate the receipt of all reports from the licensee, and verify that all financial obligations and diligence provisions are met.
- 6.8 In the event that a licensee is not in compliance with a licence agreement, the licensing officer, under the direction of the head of the Designated Office must employ proactive measures to bring the licensee in line with its obligations.
- 6.9 If the issue cannot be easily resolved, the licensing officer, in consultation with the inventor(s), will work with the licensee to determine mutually workable arrangements that help the licensee to meet the obligations.   These arrangements may include, but are not limited to,  setting up a payment plan to help the licensee meet the financial obligations to the University, setting new deadlines by which the obligations under the licence might become due or amending other terms and conditions of the licence, as may be necessary and appropriate.
- 6.10 Where issues cannot be resolved through negotiations, other means may be considered, such as initiating proceedings to suspend or terminate the licence and, in extreme circumstances, taking legal action to enforce the terms of the licence.  In taking any such action the Designated Office shall involve other parties, including the Pro Vice Chancellor, the Principal of the campus concerned, legal counsel and the inventors.
- 6.11 In exercising its functions under this Part, the Office shall -
- (a) obtain such legal, financial and other expert advice as may be necessary or desirable;
- (b) make reasonable efforts to ensure that inventor(s ) are informed of the commercialisation efforts of the Office; and
- (b) keep the Pro Vice Chancellor and the Principal of the campus concerned abreast of all developments concerning the protection and commercialisation of the invention.

## 7.0 Action by University where patent unexploited

- 7.1 . Where a patent owned by the University is not commercially exploited for a continuous period of not less than five years, the University, at its sole discretion, may discontinue the payment of annuities to maintain the patent.   When payment is discontinued, the patent will fall into the public domain. Before taking action, the University will notify the inventor(s) named in the patent of its intention to discontinue payment and of its willingness to assign the patent to the inventor(s) if, within the time-frame specified in the notice, the inventor(s) request the assignment of the patent.  On a request being so made, the University will assign the patent.

## PART III: OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

## Trade Marks

## 1.0 Introduction

- 1.1 Trade marks are words, phrases, logos or other symbols associated with the quality and reputation of products and services.  They are used to identify and distinguish the products and services of a person or entity from those of another. The owner of a trade mark enjoys exclusive rights conferred by law to use and commercially exploit the trade marks.
- 1.2 This Part of the Policy provides guidelines on the use of UWI marks (as defined in Section C of this Policy) making explicit the uses that are authorised, restricted and prohibited.

## 2.0 Ownership of UWI Marks

- 2.1 Ownership of UWI marks is vested in the University.
- 2.2 A Faculty, department or other unit of the University or a staff member or a student organisation recognised by the University that wishes: a) to design or create a new trade mark; or b) to register a trade mark on behalf of the University or for a University- related project, must make a written submission with respect to the proposed trade mark to the University Registrar or designee.

- 2.3 After consultation with legal and marketing personnel, the University Registrar or nominee will determine: a) whether or not to approve the mark as a UWI mark; and b) if the mark should be registered.
- 2.4 A trade mark created or registered by a staff member in the course of a contract of service with the University or by a student in connection with any Universityrelated activity, holds that trade mark for and on behalf of the University.

## 3. 0 Authorisation required to use UWI marks

- 3.1 Except where paragraph 4 of this Part applies, any individual, organisation or company, any faculty, department or other unit of the University and any student organisation recognised by the University that wishes to use a UWI mark must first obtain the right to do so from the University.  Authorisation must be obtained before producing or arranging for the production of any product or the offering of any service involving the use of a UWI mark.
- 3.2 For non-commercial use of UWI marks, prior written permission must be obtained from the University Registrar or designee.
- 3.3 A licence is required for the use of UWI marks on products that are manufactured for resale or other commercial purpose.
- 3.4 The office selected on each campus as the Designated Office in relation to the management of UWI marks is delegated the responsibility for the licensing of UWI marks on that campus.  The University Registrar shall have the responsibility for licensing UWI marks where the use of the marks relates to the University as a whole.  Approval of each use of a UWI mark must be on a per product, per design basis.
- 3.5 A licence shall provide for the payment of royalties and fees as provided in paragraph 8.1 below, unless the exemption in paragraph 8.2 applies.
- 3.6 Authorisation to use a UWI mark does not constitute approval to manufacture a particular product.   Only an Officially Licensed Manufacturer may manufacture products bearing a UWI mark and only an Officially Licensed Vendor may sell products bearing UWI marks.   ( For a current list of Officially Licensed

Manufacturers and Officially Licensed Vendors contact the office selected on a campus as the Designated Office for the management of UWI marks .)

- 3.7 Where the authorisation relates to the use of the name of the University and/or the University Coat of Arms, such use must conform to the standards prescribed in the Brand Identity Guidelines available at:

and to any other guidelines that may be issued by the University Registrar from

https://sta.uwi.edu/resources/policies/uwistylemanual.pdf time to time.

( If you need assistance with respect to the use of these Guidelines, contact the office at a campus responsible for marketing and communication or the Designated Office. )

## 4.0 Use of UWI marks permitted without specific authorisation
