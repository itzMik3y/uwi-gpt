## The University of the West Indies Mona Campus

FACULTY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

(Formerly Faculty of Pure &amp; Applied Sciences)

## Welcome

Congratulations on your admission to the University of the West Indies (UWI),  and  specifically  into  the  Faculty  of  Science  and  Technology (FST). You are about to begin one of the most exciting and challenging times in your life as a new student in the Faculty.

The Faculty of Science and Technology has organized a Pre-orientation Programme just  for  you.    Through  this  forum,  we  want  to  formally welcome and introduce you to academic life here in the Faculty. We also want to use this occasion to inform you of the regulations that govern the UWI  and  more  so  the  Faculty's  expectations  of  you.  Our  Dean, Associate Deans, Heads of Departments and some of our distinguished academics  and  staff  will  make  themselves  available  for  consultation during your enrollment. The Presentations will formally introduce you to the Degree's Majors and Minors offered by each department. This will be a great opportunity to build long-lasting relationships, become familiar with the registration process and the layout of the Faculty.

As  you  continue  on  another  milestone  in  your  journey  of  success remember that, 'heights by great men reached and kept were not attained by  sudden  flight,  but  they,  while  their  companions  slept,  were  upward toiling through the night.' Henry Wadsworth

## Registration

## Guidelines

##  WHEN DO CLASSES BEGIN?

To  find out when  classes begin each semester, consult the Academic  Diary. For Semester  1,  academic  year  2012/2013, teaching begins Monday, September 3, 2012.

##  HOW DO I REGISTER?

Before  you  register  for  classes,  you  must  be  admitted  to  the University  of  the  West  Indies,  Mona  Campus.  Students  can  only register for their courses using the UWI Mona Student Administration  System  (SAS).  It  is  advisable  that  you  talk  with your Department's Undergraduate Coordinator and seek academic advice.

##  WHAT   ARE PRELIMINARY COURSES?

Preliminary  Courses  are  equivalent  to  the  Caribbean  Advanced Proficiency Examinations (CAPE) and 'A' Levels.  However, the credits  that  are  accumulated  from  these  examinations  will  not  be counted as part of your general degree requirements. These credits can be used to advance students to Level I.

##  WHAT IS A LOWER LEVEL MATRICULATION?

Lower  Level  Matriculation  (Preliminary  Offer)  is  given  to  an applicant  who  does  NOT  have  the  two  pairs  of  CAPE  Science subjects or the requisite 'A' Levels passes. This degree takes four years. This offer is normally made to applicants with CSEC (CXC) passes only  or  one  'A'  Level  or  one  pair  of  CAPE  Science subject. Such  persons  are  qualified  to  do  eighteen  Preliminary Credits per semester.

Note:  Preliminary Credits do not count towards your degree credits.

##  WHAT IS UPPER LEVEL MATRICULATION?

This is referred to as Normal Matriculation. The applicant would have  satisfied  the  University  and  the  Faculty's  requirements  for matriculation.  Upper  Level  Matriculation  is  offered  to  students who  are  qualified  to  do  their  degrees  over  three  years.  Such persons are qualified to do eighteen Level I credits per semester.

Note:  This  offer  is  given  to  an  applicant  who  has  two  pairs  of CAPE/ 'A' Levels Science passes.



##  HOW MANY CREDITS CAN I REGISTER FOR EACH SEMESTER?

Full-time Student Registration :  A Full-time student can register for a minimum of 33 credits and a maximum of 39 credits  per year. That is, 18 credits per semester (a combination of 3 and/or 6 credits  courses) AND one  (1)  Foundation  Course  (3  credits)  per year = 39 Credits (Max.)

Part-time Student Registration: A  Part-time student can register  for  a  minimum  of  18  credits  and  a  maximum  of  27 credits per year. That is 12 credits per semester (a combination of 3, 5 and/or 6 credits courses) AND one (1) Foundation Course (3 credits) per year = 27 Credits (Max.)

Note: FST students MUST complete 3 Foundations Courses; EXCLUDING (FOUN1201/FD12A).

It is also highly recommended that students complete their Foundation Courses in Semester 2 of each academic year.
