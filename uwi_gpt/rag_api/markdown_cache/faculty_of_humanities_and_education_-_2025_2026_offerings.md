## IMPORTANT INFORMATION

## The Master of Education (M.Ed.) Programme

The School of Education invites applicants with at least an Upper Second Class Honours Degree at the Bachelor's level and teacher training for the programme leading to the M.Ed. on a part-time basis.  Applicants with a lower second class honours or pass degree will be considered only in exceptional cases where the candidate's professional experience and performance suggest potential for further intellectual development.  Applicants should submit teacher training transcripts along with other relevant documents.

The Master  of  Arts  -  Leadership  in  Technical  and  Vocational  Education  and  Training  (TVET)  and  Workforce Development (WFD) will be offered. This programme targets a wide range of interested professionals and is particularly suitable for the following groups/individuals:

-  Educational leaders in institutions that offer full or partial TVET curricula
-  Training managers and coordinators in public and private organizations
-  School principals and administrators (at all levels of the school system)
-  Field operations and programme officers of Ministries of Education
-  Technical and field officers of other Ministries of Government
-  Managers and technical staff of National Training Agencies
-  Managers/coordinators of skills training programme in NGOs
-  Educators/instructors interested in upward mobility in TVET systems.

Applicants should have a minimum of five years of work experience in a technical or vocational area.

The Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) programme is a two-year part-time face to face programme consisting of two parts that prepares participants to teach a specialised area at the secondary level, and to prepare their own students for national, regional and international examinations in the subject area. Seven areas of specialisation are offered.

To be eligible to pursue the programme, the applicant must hold a Bachelor's degree (at least a Lower Second Class Honours) in any of the seven specialised areas. The applicant should be teaching that specialised area at a secondary or tertiary institution. However, if the applicant is not currently teaching, he/she must be available to attend lectures and complete the required teaching practicum in the specialised area.

Participants may opt to terminate at the end of part-1, and those who are successful are awarded the Postgraduate Diploma in Education in the area of specialisation. Those who obtain an average of B+ at the end of part-1 and wish to proceed to part-2 are awarded the MAT degree on successful completion of the programme.

Thank you.
