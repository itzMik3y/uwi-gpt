## Frequently Asked Questions

## EXAMINATIONS

## I have missed an examination, what options are available to me?

If you missed an examination for medical reasons, you should submit a signed medical certificate within seven days to the Examination Section of the Registry.  You will likely be permitted to sit the exam at the next available sitting. (Refer to Examination Regulations, Section II, 17-32)

For any other reason, you would normally be obliged to register again for the full course.  However, departments, upon being advised of the situation, have other discretionary options that may be applied. Refer to the current issue of the Faculty Handbook, 'Exams Only' Regulations 11.2.

## Where should I go to check on the dates of my examinations?

Candidates are informed of the dates and times of written papers by means of the publications of the official examination timetable.

Candidates who are absent from an examination owing to a mis-reading of the timetable shall be liable to the normal penalties for absence from an examination and will have to await the next official sitting to take the examination. (Refer to Examination Regulations 2008-2009, Section V, 84-96).

## Where do I go if I want to challenge my final examination grades?

You may express your dissatisfaction with your results in writing to the Campus Registrar through the Examinations Section.  You may do so within two weeks of publication of results. (Refer to Examination Regulations 2008-2009, Section VII, 142-152 to see what other options are available to you).

No sooner than one (1) year after the date of withdrawal.

Usually the Faculty encourages and supports students wanting to pursue part of their programme at another UWI campus university.   However, students should explore the options that are available to them through the International Students Office.  Before proceeding to study abroad, The Faculty must evaluate and approve the courses that students intend to do.
