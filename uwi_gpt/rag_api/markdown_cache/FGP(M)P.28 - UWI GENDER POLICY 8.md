## FOREWORD

<!-- image -->

ur  principal  remit  at  The  University  of  the  West  Indies (UWI)  is  to  strengthen  the  internal  coherence  of  the institution in order  to  energize  its  functions  as one academy, and to critically drive forward the globalization of our brand as the premier regional university in the Caribbean. O

The finest universities are not built to serve themselves, but the communities in which they reside and those beyond. A university generally reflects the societal norms and is indeed a microcosm  of  the  society  in  which  it  exists.  It  is  imperative therefore,  that  at  UWI  we  make  deliberate  and  transformative

progress in regards to gender, gender diversity and social inclusion, not just honouring, but celebrating the human rights of all in our midst.

The University's commitment to gender mainstreaming, gender equality and Gender Justice as articulated in this Gender Policy, must be fully reflected in the University's structure, systems, policies  and  programmes. The importance of gender in education at UWI was articulated as early  as  1944  in  the  findings  of  the  Irvine  Commission  that  resulted  in  the  University's formation; in this current period of our history it is vital for the University to take the steps necessary  to  further  that  agenda  in  a  meaningful  way,  recognizing  the  inextricable  links between Gender Justice and the sustainable development of the region.

I am therefore pleased to present the University of the West Indies' Gender Policy to all of our staff, students, partners and other stakeholders with the commitment that this University will be a  beacon,  lighting  a  path  of  progress  in  relation  to  gender  issues  throughout  the  Caribbean region.    We  are  grateful  to  the  Institute  for  Gender  and  Development  Studies  for  their stewardship and commitment to the delivery of this Gender Policy. Guided by this Policy, the University  will  seek  to  work  in  partnership  with  our  member  governments  to  seek  equality, fairness and justice throughout these West Indies to ensure that gender will not be a limiting factor in shaping the potential and the future of the people of these nations.

Professor Sir Hilary Beckles Vice-Chancellor The University of the West Indies

## 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Gender and The University of the West Indies

The  University  of  the  West  Indies  (UWI)  has  historically  concerned  itself  with  issues  of Gender Justice.  From  its  inception  the  founders  of  The  UWI  were  careful  to  include  in  the Report of the West Indies Committee of the Commission on Higher Education in the Colonies, (The Irvine Committee Report  of June 1945), its recommendations that in its establishment, 1 the University College of the West Indies (the predecessor of The UWI)

should be open to women on precisely the same terms and conditions as are applicable to men.  Similarly, no restriction should be imposed on grounds of race or creed…

It was believed that such an approach to governance was important, since

… with  greater  access  …  the  influence  of  women,  valuable  in  itself  and  perhaps especially requisite for the solution of the difficult social problems of the West Indies would make itself felt.'

The sentiments of the Committee, and its subsequent report, were further reflected in Clause Four of The UWI Charter (1949, updated in 1962 and 1972), which notes that

Men and women shall be eligible for admission to and as students of the University, and for appointment to any Authority, office or employment of or under the University.

Over  the  almost  seventy  years  since  its  establishment,  The  UWI  has  made  commendable strides towards mainstreaming gender into its operations and procedures.

The establishment of the Centre for Gender and Development Studies in 1993, which emerged from  the  advocacy  work  of  the  University-wide  Women's  Studies  Groups;  and  is  now  an independent  inter-disciplinary Institute speaks  to the University's understanding  of  the necessity to challenging patriarchal systems, which privilege some but deny others.

The decision to deliberately  design the Centre  outside of the  traditional  Faculty  structure  of The UWI was also indicative of an understanding of Gender as a cross-cutting issue, as well as an understanding of how gender organises society and social relations in fundamental ways and thus  has  implications  for  the  development  of  curricula  and  pedagogy;  and  structures  and systems of governance.  Gender Mainstreaming, grounded in the principle of Gender Justice, is a necessary tool through which to imagine and enact new societal possibilities and fresh ways of thinking through the old challenges of social injustice.

The  commitment  to  gender  mainstreaming  its  operations  was  again  reiterated  at  the  2012  2017 UWI Strategic Framework Planning Retreat, where the development and implementation of a Gender Policy was identified as a priority.

The Strategic Plan (2012-2017) commits The UWI to:

…build  a  community  that  fosters  a  climate  which  is  open  and  welcoming  to  diverse people,  ideas  and  perspectives;  that  promotes  constructive  discourse  on  the  nature  of diversity;  and  that  engages  faculty,  staff  and  students  in  activities  that  promote  the University's core values…. The UWI will be an equal opportunity employer and partner ensuring  that  social  justice,  respect  and  equity  issues  are  resolved  as  they  relate  to processes  and  challenges  associated  with  employment,  religion,  age,  ability,  gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, the work environment, class and any other bases of inequality and  inequity  among  employees  and  students  (p.23).  The  UWI  also  committed  to developing a gender policy to create a supportive environment for women and men in all aspects of University life (p. 30).

The UWI Gender Policy is intended to be a framework to guide that creation of  ' a supportive environment for both men and women in all aspects of university life' .

## 1.2 Why a UWI Gender Policy?

Congruent with its roots and re-emergence as an Activist University, the development of The UWI Gender Policy will place the University on the vanguard of engaging in  advocacy and producing transformative policy for social change, as the first tertiary learning institution in the English-speaking Caribbean to develop and operationalise such a policy.

As  a  member  of  the  Association  of  Commonwealth  of  Universities  (ACU),  The  UWI  is mandated to address issues in university governance, management and administration, which may  have  given  rise  to  gender  inequality;  as  well  as  to  explore  women-specific  issues  in diagnosing and addressing inequities.  The ACU advocates:

-  an appropriate action plan for a gender management system to support the mainstreaming of gender developed
-  integration of gender into university curriculum and research
-  incorporation of gender into instructional methods and techniques
-  establishment and/or strengthening of gender-sensitive policies with regard to admission to and for the administration and academic management of the university
-  encouragement and establishment of gender-inclusive extra-curricular activities
-  specific  provision  for  social  and  career  guidance  to  ensure  that  women  students  and staff are fully integrated in universities

## Figure 1.1: Why a UWI Gender Policy

## Why a UWI Gender Policy

Despite some women academics and administrators attaining power and leadership within their universities, a majority of university women still face many structural and attitudinal impediments; they have to work within environments of gender insensitivity and are forced to deal with cultures of  gender  discrimination  very  often  on  a  daily  basis.  …[What  is  required]  are  far  reaching changes  to  the  structures,  cultures,  general  working  environments  and  practices  of  higher education institutions as well as, most significantly, people's attitudes…These changes need to take into consideration local campus concerns such as gender violence including ragging / sexual harassment in universities, student micropolitics and the gendered division of labour in academia. Furthermore, they also need to account for the ongoing transitions of universities worldwide in the face  of  the  rapidly  expanding  knowledge  economies,  and  the  resultant  competitiveness  and output-orientation of higher education institutions. Moreover,  they need to learn from the gains, problems and weaknesses of women's empowerment programmes and gender mainstreaming (GM) efforts that have been taking place for the past three decades.

Introduction to Gender Mainstreaming Universities Maithree Wickramasinghe (For the Commonwealth Association of Universities)

Critically,  the  development  of  The  UWI  Gender  Policy  will  ensure  that  The  UWI  as  an institution is:

-  operating within best practices for tertiary institutions, where steps have been taken to ensure  that  Gender  Justice  is  promoted  and  championed  at  all  levels;  and  that  all systems of governance, official documents, policies, procedures, curriculum development and pedagogy are gender sensitive;
-  aligned to and compliant with international, regional and national protocols including to promote Gender Justice; which all Caribbean countries have ratified.

Figure 1.2: Policy Context for the Development of The UWI Gender Policy

<!-- image -->

The  UWI  Gender  Policy  is  particularly  opportune,  at  a  time  when  heightened  focus  on numerical advantage in favour of females, both as staff and student, has the potential to mask the reality of the broader situation that is indicative of deeper systemic societal issues which can potentially threaten the possibilities for  Gender Justice; and are best understood through the lens of gender.

Figure 1.3: Understanding Gender

## GENDER

Encompasses  complex  systems  of  personal  and social  relations  through  which  women  and  men are  socially  created  and  maintained  and  through which they gain access to, or are allocated, status, power and material resources within society .

(Barriteau, 1998)

Figure 1.4: Understanding Gender Justice

## GENDER JUSTICE

A societal condition in which there are no asymmetries of access to, or allocation of, status, power and material resources  in  a  society,  'or  in the control over and capacity to benefit from these resources.

(Barriteau 2004)

No more clearly is this evidenced than in the access to The UWI's services by female students, in  comparison to the access to positions of executive leadership by female academics in the institution.

Despite  the  numerical  advantages  in  the  former  instance,  it  would  seem  -  and  has  been reported anecdotally - that patriarchal ideologies persist, which run counter to the creation of an enabling environment in which Gender Justice is mandated, facilitated or realized.

The Situation Analysis presented in Appendix 4, offers additional insights into areas in need of attention.

## 1.3 What is The UWI Gender Policy Intended to Accomplish?

This Gender Policy is intended to guide The UWI's actions to mainstream gender across the institution  by  ensuring  gender  equity  in  all  University  practices,  policies,  procedures  and programmes.

More specifically, The UWI Gender Policy seeks to embed strategies to address existing and potential  disparities,  and  to  offer  alternatives  to  systemic  and  attitudinal  practices  that  may reinforce gender prejudice, stereotyping, harassment , 2 gender based violence and discrimination; and deny members of The UWI community access to Gender Justice.

These strategies are essential in the maintenance of the sustainability of the institution and its stakeholders; and ultimately can only redound to the benefit of the entire Caribbean region; and its diasporas.

Excerpt from the Irvine Committee Report (1945) The Position of Women

## 2.1 The Chronology of developing The UWI Gender Policy

## 2007

The need for a Gender Plan/Policy is raised by the IGDS

## 2011

The Board for Gender and Development Studies on the Mona Campus (of which the IGDS University Director is a  member),  repeats  the  recommendations  to  the  Vice Chancellor  that a Gender  Policy  for The  UWI  be developed.

The  University  of  the  West  Indies  drafts  its  Strategic Plan  for  2012-2017.    Under  the  theme  of  Employee Engagement,  the  University  duly  signaled  its  intention to develop a Gender Policy for the Institution.

## 2014

In  September  2014,  the  first  of  a  series  of  Steering Committee  meetings  is  held  to  begin  development  of the Gender Policy for the University of the West Indies. Discussions center on what would be the Vision, Mission, Values and Guiding Principles of the Policy

## 2016

A revised Draft Policy is prepared in April 2016, which is reviewed  at  the  IGDS  Regional  Planning  and Strategy Meeting , May  2016,  convened  in  St.  Augustine  and comments received

A UWI Gender Policy Working Group is established to further review the Draft Policy and bring it to completion.

## JUNE 2017

The Draft of The UWI Gender Policy is approved at the June  02,  2017  meeting  of  The  UWI  Finance  and General Purposes Committee.

## 2009

In August 2009 at a foresighting meeting preparatory to the development  of  the  University's Strategic Plan (2012-2017), the IGDS Professors present (Professors Eudine Barriteau, Patricia Mohammed, Rhoda Reddock and Verene Shepherd [University Director of the IGDS]), call for attention to be given to issues of gender within  the  Strategic  Framework;  and  to  be  explicitly noted within the Strategic Plans.

## 2012

In January 2012 the University Registrar indicates that The UWI executive management committee had commissioned the IGDS to prepare a Gender Policy for The UWI.  A UWI Gender Policy Steering Committee is developed to guide the preparation of the Gender Policy, chaired by Professor Verene A. Shepherd, University Director of the IGDS

## 2015

Research is completed by each IGDS Unit towards the development of a Gender Audit of The UWI, to inform the content of the Gender Policy

December 2015, a Draft Policy is prepared

## April 2017

The Penultimate Draft of The UWI Gender Policy is completed by Professor Verene A. Shepherd and Mrs. Suzanne M. Charles Watson

## 2.2 The Process of  developing The UWI Gender Policy

## 2.2.1 The UWI Gender Policy Steering Committee

The  UWI  Gender  Policy  Steering  Committee  was  directed  by  its  mandate  to  offer expertise and technical guidance, as well as to establish the scope and sequence of the process, towards the preparation of The UWI Gender Policy.

Operating within the framework of regional commitments such as the CARICOM Plan of Action for Gender Equality and various national initiatives throughout the region, the Steering Committee's work was informed by the existing legal structures of The UWI; and the Gender Policies of other Universities.

The Steering Committee (See Appendix 2) comprised:

-  the University Registrar
-  the University Counsel
-  The UWI Office of Planning and Institutional Research
-  the University Director, IGDS
-  the Heads of each of the IGDS campus-based Units
-  staff representation from each IGDS Campus Unit
-  staff representation from the IGDS Reginal Coordinating Office
-  representation from The UWI Open Campus
-  representation from The Women and Development Unit (WAND)
-  the University Director, Marketing and Communications
-  the Office of Marketing and Communications, Mona Campus
-  the Marketing and Communications Officer, Institutional Advancement Division,
- St. Augustine Campus
-  the Marketing and Communications Manager, Open Campus
-  the Gender Equity Advisor
-  the Consultant(s) engaged to complete the drafting of the Gender Policy

## 2.2.2 UWI Gender Audit (Campus-Based Research and Advocacy)

Over  the  course  of  developing  The  UWI  Gender  Policy,  each  IGDS  Unit  completed research and consultations towards the completion of  a university-wide Gender Audit. The  Gender  Audit  was  intended  to  determine  the  extent  to  which  concerns  of  gender were mainstreamed into the programmes, procedures and practices of The UWI.

Using apposite research methodologies, including but not limited to desk reviews, focus group discussions and the administration of survey instruments, each campus conducted research among staff and students to identify the key issues impacting gender equality and justice; on each respective campus.

Results from the research interventions on each campus formed part of a UWI Gender Situation Analysis, which was indicative of the critical gender issues to be addressed by The UWI Gender Policy.

As part of the campus interventions, Gender Policy Champions - senior administrators were  appointed  on  each  campus  who  advocated  for  resources  to  support  the  Policy's development and operationalization.

## 2.2.3 UWI Gender Policy Consultants

Under  the  guidance  of  The  UWI  Gender  Policy  Steering  Committee,  Consultants worked to collate the respective Campus Based research and complete Working Draft of The UWI Gender Policy.  (See Appendix 2 for list of Consultants)

## 2.2.4 The UWI Gender Policy Working Group

To bring the process to completion, a UWI Policy Working Group was established. The Working  Group's  mandate  was  to  review  the  Draft  Submission  and  offer  pointed suggestions on the ways in which the Policy could be better articulated.  A Rapporteur was appointed to revise the Draft Submission.

The Working Group (See Appendix 2) comprised:

-  the University Director, IGDS, who served as Chair
-  staff representation from each IGDS Campus Unit
-  staff representation of the IGDS Regional Coordinating Office
-  representation from The UWI Open Campus

## 2.2.5 Finalising the Gender Policy

The  Draft  Gender  Policy  was  finalised,  through  a  process  of  review  by  key  UWI stakeholders; and ultimately through approval from the Council of the University.

## 2.2.6 Disseminating The UWI Gender Policy

The  UWI  Gender  Policy  will  be  disseminated  in  popular  format  by  the  respective campus-based Marketing and Communications offices to raise awareness and sensitize all UWI Stakeholders to its principles.

## 3. The Gender Policy

## 3.1 A Vision for The UWI Gender Policy

The UWI Gender Policy affirms for all the staff, students and other stakeholders of the University  of  the  West  Indies  the  fundamental  principles  of  gender  equality,  gender diversity  and  non-discrimination  based  on  gender  and  sexuality  in  all  of  the  policies, programmes, practices and structures of the University and in its external relationships in the Caribbean region and beyond.

## 3.2 The Mission of The UWI Gender Policy 3

The UWI Gender Policy will support the integration of gender equality, gender diversity and  non-discrimination  in  all  structures  and  functions  of  The  UWI's  organisational environment, affording equal opportunities for staff, students and all other stakeholders irrespective  of  gender  identity  or  diversity,  sexual  orientation  and  producing  gendersensitive  graduates  that  are  fully  equipped  to  contribute  to  a  just  and  equitable  society throughout the Caribbean region and globally.

In  furtherance of this Mission, the University will be guided by the principles outlined below.

## 3.3 How The UWI Gender Policy Will Work

The  Gender  Policy  of  the  University  of  the  West  Indies'  expresses  the  University's commitment  to  Gender  Justice  and  articulates  a  framework  for  its  implementation, monitoring and evaluation. The UWI Gender Policy:

-  articulates core principles;
-  proposes a number of gender-related issues to be addressed;
-  identifies gender mainstreaming strategies, including advocacy, congruent with The UWI activist mandate, to produce graduates and engage staff who are socially conscious; and are committed to social justice and the promotion of genderresponsive human relations and development.

The  Gender  Policy  will  inform  changes  required  within  the  University's  structures, policies,  programmes  and  practices  to  promote  and  facilitate  Gender  Justice,  and  to address the root causes of gender inequality and discrimination as it relates to all internal and external stakeholders, including all students, employees, persons under its independent service arrangements, other persons who provide academic services to the University,  as  well  as  to  its  contractual  agreements,  independent  service  arrangements and its interaction with members of the public.

## Moreover, The UWI Gender Policy will serve as a template for:

##  Promoting Gender Planning and Mainstreaming

An awareness of gender as a key organising feature of personal, social and institutional relations should undergird programme planning and implementation towards the achievement of the University's goals.

This  Gender  Policy  represents  UWI's  commitment  to  take  positive  steps  towards institutionalising  Gender  Planning.    This  will  include  providing  policy  guidelines  and  the resources  necessary  to  address  gender  inequalities  and  ensure  just  opportunities  and outcomes at the operational level in administration; as well as in pedagogy.

Additionally, Gender mainstreaming (with its attention to exposing and changing unequal relations  of  power  based  on  gender)  in  all  facets  of  decision-making,  research  and institutional  development  at  The  UWI  will  create  an  environment  devoid  of  stereotypes and discrimination, which ultimately will redound to the benefit of the broader Caribbean society.

##  Protecting Human Rights

Within a human-rights based framework, the attainment of Gender Justice is critical.   As The  UWI  recognises  and  upholds  the  human  rights  of  all  its  stakeholders  The  UWI Gender  Policy  will  recognise  the  rights  and  responsibilities  of  all  its constituents, irrespective  of  categories  of  difference  including  but  not  limited  to  sex,  gender  identity, sexual  orientation,  race/ethnicity,  ability/disability,  religion,  age,  socio-economic  status, nationality or place of origin.

##  Ensuring Sustainable Development

The achievement of Gender Justice and equality has been identified globally as a critical prerequisite of sustainable development.  The UWI - particularly as an Activist University has a crucial role to play in shaping a culture of Gender Justice through the development and engagement of a cadre of gender aware citizens who are committed to promoting sustainable and inclusive development.

This Gender Policy is a statement of UWI's commitment to take positive steps to institutionalising Gender Planning. This will include providing policy guidelines and the resources  necessary  to  address  gender  inequalities and ensure just opportunities and outcomes at the operational  level  in  administration;  as  well  as  in pedagogy.

## 3.4 Guiding Principles for The UWI Gender Policy

The UWI Gender policy presents an opportunity to create a deeper gender consciousness among  all  the  University's  stakeholders.  In  order  for  The  UWI  Gender  Policy  to  be impactful  as  an  instrument  of  social  justice  and  sustainable  development,  it  must  be undergirded by the following principles

##  Leadership  and Political Will

To  educate  leaders  and  contribute  to  shaping  a  vision  for  our  world,  our  leaders  must embody the principles of social justice and human rights and dedicate our strengths to ensuring that these translate into action.

##  Non-discrimination and an Appreciation of Diversity

This requires:

-  the promotion and protection of rights and freedoms for all persons, irrespective of their gender identity, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, ability/disability, religion, age and any other category of difference.
-  recognition that the complex and heterogeneous production of gender and sexual identity, which are not reducible to a simplistic male/female binary, must be taken into account to ensure that The UWI honours its commitment to non-discrimination.

The UWI is well positioned as an Activist University; and particularly through the Gender Policy;  to  build  on  a  long  history  of  struggle  against  intersecting  inequalities  in  the Caribbean, most often around the race, class, gender and sexuality.

##  Gender and Social Justice

Gender  justice  requires  the  elimination  of  hierarchies  of  gender  identities  (that  is,  the differential valuing of femininity, masculinity and gender non-conformity) which underpins gender inequalities.

##  Personal Responsibility and Accountability

It shall be the responsibility of all UWI Stakeholders to ensure compliance with the Gender Policy; and uphold the principles and spirit of the Policy. The Executive Management of The  UWI  must  assume  responsibility  for  the  creation  of  systems  and  structures  that facilitate a collective consciousness around Gender Justice and equal rights; as well as an organisational culture and governance framework conducive to Gender Justice. These will necessarily include institutional, organisational and operational systems and structures to address inequalities.

##  Collaboration and Partnership Development

Sustainable  development  is  possible  only  if  the  mechanisms  to  communicate  and collaborate across difference are enhanced.

## 3.5 Strategic Objectives

The UWI Gender Policy is intended to act as the framework to inform changes necessary at  the  institutional,  structural,  policy,  procedural  and  the  personal  levels  at  The  UWI towards the promotion of Gender Justice. It is also the blueprint, to incorporate the issues of  gender and development; and to express the fundamental principles that are deemed vital to sustainable growth and development.

The Strategic Objectives outlined below have been  identified as areas for intervention, through research conducted across the entire University.

The areas identified also form the foundation for the development of a series of actions required to operationalize the vision of the Gender Policy.

##  The Curriculum

The University of the West Indies will take the necessary steps to ensure that its curricula acknowledge and promote gender equality and Gender Justice

##  Student Enrolment, Retention &amp; Performance

The  UWI  will  seek  to  examine  (and  where  necessary)  address  underrepresentation  of male  and  female  students,  respectively  in  its  programmes;  particularly  those  linked  to growing  sectors  of  the  economy  or  that  are  key  to  regional  development.    Gender mainstreaming in the development of content and pedagogy will be also undertaken, to ensure that all programs create engaged learners

##  Human Resource Management

The  UWI  will  seek  to  examine  and  (where  necessary)  address  disparities  in  staff recruitment, training, promotion and recognition at all levels, across all categories of staff, with  a  focus  on  the  recruitment,  retention  and  promotion  of  qualified  members  of  staff, irrespective  of  categories  of  difference  including  but  not  limited  to  sex,  gender  identity, sexual  orientation,  race/ethnicity,  ability/disability,  religion,  age,  socio-economic  status, nationality or place of origin.

Additionally, The UWI will consider issues of equity by taking deliberate action to improve the quality of working conditions to enhance employee confidence and engagement and to promote work/life balance, towards the creation of engaged employees

Towards that end, The UWI will support (and continue to support):

-  parental leave (including for adoption) for all members of staff
-  the right to reproductive and childcare support and facilities for students and staff, including but not limited to child friendly infrastructure/facilities in all bathrooms (e.g. safe  and  comfortable  designated  areas  for  breastfeeding  and  kindergarten  and after-care facilities.)

##  Participation, Leadership and Decision-Making

The  UWI  will  seek  to  deliberately  facilitate  and  increase  participation  by  women  in positions  of  leadership  and  decision-making;  towards  more  egalitarian  and  equitable arrangements.

The UWI recognises that equally important as numerical parity between all groups of staff, is the creation and maintenance of an enabling environment in which all members of staff are  equally  able  to  advance  up  the  hierarchy  on  the  basis  of  merit;  as  well  as  an environment in which executive decisions are made in the spirit of the Mission and Vision of The UWI Gender Policy, towards the creation of Gender Justice.

##  Organisational Culture, Custom and Practice

The UWI will identify and address systemic biases that exist in its organisational culture that do not promote, support or enable gender equity and justice.

The UWI will also promote and support increased gender equality in decision- making, networking and partnerships.

##  Finance and Resource Management

The UWI will endeavour to mobilize the necessary and appropriate resources - human, technical and financial - to complete gender mainstreaming activities, which promote and support non-discrimination, diversity and gender equality towards Gender Justice.

##  Staff and Student Well-being

The UWI will commit to monitoring and investing in, where appropriate and practicable, the well-being of all staff and students, irrespective of categories of difference.

##  Safe and Secure Environment

The Management and administration of The UWI will foster a secure environment where students and staff on all campuses feel protected and safe from any form of violence that is  as  a  result  of  their  sexual  orientation,  gender,  gender  identity  or  gender  identity expression

##  Gender and the Built Environment

The UWI will also seek to adequately and appropriately address gender related issues which impact, or are impacted by, the University's living, working and learning environments across the University.

##  Research and Development

The UWI will encourage and support, across its faculties, policy indicative  research and innovation, which acknowledges, supports and promotes Gender justice.

##  Language

The  UWI  will  examine,  and  change  where  necessary,  any  sexist  language  that  is contained within its ordinances, rules, regulations and policy documents; as well as within all curricula

The  UWI  Gender  Policy  is  intended  to  act  as  the framework to inform changes necessary at the institutional,  structural,  policy,  procedural  and  the personal levels at The UWI towards the promotion of Gender Justice. It is also the blueprint, to incorporate  the  issues  of  gender  and  development; and  to  express  the  fundamental  principles  that  are deemed vital to sustainable growth and

## 3.7 Responsibility for the Operationalisation of the Gender Policy - UWI Gender Policy Organogram

The UWI Gender Policy: Promoting Gender Justice for All

<!-- image -->

## 3.8 Roles and Responsibilities for the Operationalisation of the Gender Policy

All staff, students and other stakeholders within the University, and all those associated with the University have a responsibility to adhere to the Gender Policy and to apply its tenets in their day-to-day activities and in all dealings with, or on behalf of the institution. The overall responsibilities in relation to this Policy are as follows:

##  The University Council and Chancellor

The University Council, lead by the Chancellor, is ultimately responsible for the promotion of Gender Justice at The University of the West Indies. Towards this end, the University Council will receive periodic progress reports from the Gender Mainstreaming Committee, on the implementation of the Policy, to enable its members to ensure that the Policy is being satisfactorily applied to the operations of the university.

##  The Vice-Chancellor

The Vice Chancellor, who - through his Triple-A Vision - has consistently called for The University of the West Indies to be an Activist space, will have responsible for ensuring that the Policy is satisfactorily applied to all operations of the university; as Chair of the Gender Mainstreaming Committee.

The Vice-Chancellor will ensure that the appropriate protocols and guidelines are in place to guarantee that action is taken against staff or students who breach or violate the Policy.

The  Vice-Chancellor  will  rely  on  the  Pro  Vice-Chancellors  and  other  members  of  the senior management of the University to reinforce the tenets of The UWI Gender Policy; and facilitate its full operationalisation.

##  Executive Management

The  Pro  Vice-Chancellors  and  senior  Officers  and  Managers  of  the  University  will  be obliged to facilitate the incorporation of gender into the management of their respective portfolios, towards the creation of Gender Justice.

##  Principals, Deans/Directors, Heads of Departments, Institutes, Sites, Centres, Units &amp; Schools

Principals,  Deans/Directors,  Heads  of  Departments,  Institutes,  Sites,  Centres,  Units  &amp; Schools will assume responsibility for operationalizing the Gender Policy, in tandem with the Gender Mainstreaming Committee and respective campus Gender Task Force.

This  will  involve  developing  mechanisms  to  sensitise  members  of  staff;  as  well  as students;  to  the  content  of  The  UWI  Gender  Policy,  through  training,  ensuring  that  all members of  staff  and  students  are  aware  of  their  rights  and  responsibilities  under  the policy; and taking necessary and suitable action where staff or students discriminate on grounds of gender.

##  Campus Registrars

On each Campus, the Campus registrar will appoint the Gender Task Force, develop its Terms  of  Reference,  in  collaboration  with  the  Gender  Mainstreaming  Committee  and facilitate  its  work  towards  the  implantation  and  operationalisation  of  The  UWI  Gender Policy

##  Gender Task Force

On each Campus, a Gender Task Force will lead the operationalization of the Policy and monitor  progress  towards  the  agreed  outcomes.    Each  Gender  Task  Force  will  be accountable to the Gender Mainstreaming Committee for developing and implementing the Gender Mainstreaming Action Plans.

Each Task Force will work in tandem with its respective Marketing and Communications Office  to  disseminate  information  about  The  UWI  Gender  Policy  as  well  as  about  the requirements for its successful implementation and operationalization.

##  The Institute for Gender &amp; Development Studies

The IGDS will provide expert advice and capacity-building services across the University in the  area  of  gender  and  gender  mainstreaming,  where  required,  to  support  the operationalization of the Policy.

##  Staff and Students

All  staff  and  students  will  be  encouraged  to  promote  gender  equality  in  their  various spheres of influence; towards the maintenance of zero-tolerance for gender injustice

##  Partners, Contractors and Service Providers

All external stakeholders, including persons under its independent service arrangements; as  well  as  other  persons  who  provide  academic  services  to  the  University  based  on contractual  independent  service  agreements  and  arrangements,  will  be  requested  to comply with its core principles.

All  service  providers  will  have  a  clause  inserted  into  their  contracts  whereby  they  are required to abide by the tenets of The UWI Gender Policy.

## 3.9 Institutional &amp; Legal Frameworks

The successful implementation of the Gender Policy demands a collaborative approach; across  various  offices  with  the  university.  The  policy  will  be  operationalised  through existing  structures  and  frameworks  at  The  UWI;  as  well  as  by  way  of  new  structures, created for the explicit purpose of meeting the objectives of the Gender Policy.

The proposed framework includes the Gender Mainstreaming Committee, to be chaired by the University's Vice-Chancellor or his designee.  This Committee will include senior members of UWI's Faculty or Administration to be appointed by each Campus, called Gender  Policy  Champions,  who  will  advocate  for  decisions  to  be  made  and  resources allocated  in  furtherance  of  the  mission  of  the  Gender  Policy.    The  Committee  will  be provided with technical support from the Legal Unit, the Marketing &amp; Communications Offices  and  the  Institute  for  Gender  and  Development  Studies  (IGDS).    The  Gender Mainstreaming Committee will oversee the setting up of a Gender Task Force on each Campus to ensure that annual action plans are developed,  resourced, implemented and evaluated  to  address  the  objectives  laid  out  in  the  attached  Strategic  Framework  for Action.

The University of the West Indies will conduct a Gender Audit of its existing policies and guidelines  to  ensure  alignment  and  coherence  with  the  principles  embodied  in  this Gender Policy.  Where appropriate, guidelines will be developed to address breaches of the Policy and a mechanism for redress relating to any misconduct.

This Gender Policy will become effective  upon approval by the Financial and General Purposes Committee (F&amp;GPC) of the University of the West Indies and adoption by the University of the West Indies Council.

## 3.10 Monitoring and Evaluation of the Gender Policy

The success of the Gender Policy will require routine monitoring and periodic evaluation (every three years) to assess the extent to which the University is mainstreaming gender equality across all its functions; and ensure that the University is effectively implementing and achieving the objectives of the Policy.

The Vice-Chancellor, as Chair of the Gender Mainstreaming Committee, will appoint a Monitoring and Evaluation Committee to oversee the development of progress reports for review by the University Council; and dissemination as appropriate.  Both qualitative and quantitative  measures  will  be  used  to  assess  the  progress  towards  gender  equality  and justice at the University of the West Indies.

The Gender Mainstreaming Committee will - using established performance measures monitor  the  progress  of  this  Policy  based  on  Campus  Gender  Mainstreaming  Action Plans,  developed  and  agreed  to  by  each  Campus  Gender  Task  Force  in  line  with  the Policy's objectives.

Under  the  direction  of  the  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  Expert,  a Monitoring  and Evaluation Framework will be established as a guide for critical gender analysis, through

the identification of indicators that can be used.  Where appropriate, every attempt will be made to use established indicators of measurement that are, or can be, sex-disaggregated.

Specific targets for each indicator will be documented in Campus Mainstreaming Action Plans by each Gender Task Force to reflect the local situation and the proposed changes in relation to each strategic objective.  Effective monitoring and evaluation of progress to gender equality and justice will depend on all staff, students and stakeholders approaching  data  collection,  analysis  and  reporting  with  a  focus  on  gender  as  a  key organizing feature of institutional and social relations.

## WORKING DEFINITION

Diversity

Empowerment

Gender

Gender Analysis

Gender Audit

refers to an understanding that each individual is unique, and recognizing our  individual  differences.  The  issue  of  diversity  is  made  explicit  when considered along the dimensions of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, age, physical abilities, religious beliefs, political beliefs, or other ideologies.

is the process of gaining access to resources, opportunities and decisionmaking processes, and of developing the skills, abilities and confidence to participate  actively  in  shaping  one's  own  life  and  one's  community  in economic, social and political terms.

encompasses complex systems of culturally-defined personal and social ( economic  and  political) relations  through  which  women  and  men  are socially created and maintained; and through which they gain access to, or are allocated, status, power and material resources within society.

entails  the  collection  and  analysis  of  sex-disaggregated  information  in order  to  understand  gender  differences  and  how  these  differences  may have  an  effect  on  social  relations  and  the  effectiveness  of  policies  and programmes.  Gender  analysis  of  sex  disaggregated  data  can  guide interventions that promote gender equality and equity (fairness).

According to the United Nations Development  Programme  (UNDP), Gender Analysis refers to the variety of methods  used to understand the relationships  between  men  and  women,  their  access  to  resources,  their activities,  and  the  constraints  they  face  relative  to  each  other.  Gender analysis provides information that recognizes that gender, and its relationship with race, ethnicity, culture, class, age, disability, and/or other status, is important in understanding the different patterns of involvement, behaviour and activities that women and men have in economic, social and legal structures

is  an  evaluation  process  aimed  at  determining  whether  set  policies  or interventions  are  doing  that  which  they  are  meant  to  be  doing.  It  is  an Institution's  self-assessment,  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  interventions with the broad aim of diagnosis and transformation.

## WORKING DEFINITION

## Gender-Based Violence (GBV)

Gender Bias

Gender Blindness

Gender Discrimination

Gender Equality

Gender Equity

is the general term used to capture violence that occurs as a result of the normative gender role expectations associated with each sex, along with the unequal power relationships between genders, within the context of a specific society; and that result in, or is likely to result in physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering.

GBV  tends  to  affect  women  disproportionately,  and  includes,  but  in  not limited  to  rape,  (including  attempt  to  rape),  assault  or  battery,  including spousal assault or battery, sexual bullying, sexual coercion, verbal assault based on sexual issues that violate the rights of men or women.

An important aspect of GBV is how gender and sexuality intersect to produce uneven outcomes for girls, women, gender non-conforming persons and persons whose sexuality is enacted or perceived to be non-normative.

Though GBV affects  women  disproportionately,  when  compared  to  men, there are groups of men who are victims of GBV violence based on their gender identity expression.

is the  conscious  or  unconscious  privileging  or  prejudice  against  one gender,  with  a  range  of  potentially  long-term  and  oftentimes  negative consequences for specific genders.

is the failure to recognise that gender is an essential determinant of social outcomes  impacting  on  projects  and  policies;  according  to  the  United Nations  Development  Programme.  A  gender  blind  approach  assumes gender is not an influencing factor in projects, programs or policy

according to the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women  (CEDAW), refers to any distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the  basis of socially constructed  gender roles and norms, which prevents a person from enjoying full human rights

is the status through which  males  and  females  have  equal  rights, freedoms, conditions, and opportunities for realizing their full potential and for  contributing  to  and  benefiting  from  economic,  social,  cultural,  and political development.  It is indicative of society valuing all genders equally

advocates for fairness of treatment of all genders, according to their respective socio-cultural, economic and political needs; taking into account barriers which may exist for specific groups (usually women and subordinated men)

To that end, the accomplishment of gender equity often requires measures to compensate for the historical and social disadvantages faced by certain groups.

In that way gender equity denotes an element of interpretation of social justice, usually based on tradition, custom, religion or culture, which is most often to the detriment to women.

## WORKING DEFINITION

Gender Gap

Gender Identity

Gender Indicators

Gender Integration

Gender Justice

Gender Mainstreaming

Gender Planning

Gender-Responsive

Gender-Sensitivity

is the difference that exists between males and females in access to some social good or benefit; based solely on their difference in gender.

refers to one's internal sense of being male, female, neither or both. This may or may not align with norms attached to birth-assigned gender or with sex assignment at birth.

refer  to  quantitative  or  qualitative  measures  based  on  sex-disaggregated statistical data that capture gender-related changes over time.

refers to strategies applied in programmatic  design,  implementation, monitoring  and  evaluation  to  take  gender  considerations  (as  defined above,  in  'gender')  into  account  and  to  compensate  for  gender-based inequalities.

- a  societal  condition  in  which  there  are  no  asymmetries  of  access  to,  or allocation of, status, power and material resources in a society, 'or in the control  over  and  capacity  to  benefit  from  these  resources.    (Barriteau, 2004)

is  a  process  of  incorporating  a  gender  perspective  into  organizational policies, strategies,  and  administrative  functions,  as  well  as  into  the institutional  culture  of  an  organisation.  This  process  at  the  organizational level ideally results in meaningful gender integration as outlined above.

relates to the technical and political processes and procedures necessary to implement gender-sensitive policy.

refers to actions taken to correct gender bias and discrimination so as to promote and ensure Gender Justice.  This concept refers to planning and carrying  out  programmes,  policies  or  activities  in  ways  that  consider  the different needs of men/boys and women/girls and involve them in decisionmaking,  participation  and  opportunities.  This  usually  requires  developing specific actions to bring about more equitable gender relationships, and it may require clearly targeted budget allocations.

is the awareness and insight into the state of the other sex, with reference to historical roots  of sexist stereotyping,  discrimination  and  violence. Gender Sensitivity acknowledges the different roles and responsibilities of women  and  men  in  society and the consequent differential power relationships between them. It makes one aware that men and women are different, and therefore their experiences, needs, issues and priorities are different;  and  strategies  to  achieve  equitable  outcomes  for  women  and men will be specific to various groups of men and women.

## TERM

## WORKING DEFINITION

## Gender Stereotypes

Gender Targets

Patriarchy

Sex-disaggregated Data

Sexuality

Sexual Harassment

Sexual Orientation

Violence against Women

ascribe  to  an  individual  specific  attributes,  characteristics,  or  roles  by reason only of his or her or his membership in a particular group.

Gender Stereotypes are generalised homogenising views or preconceptions about attributes or characteristics that  are - or thought to be - possessed by groups of women and men. A gender stereotype often limits  women's  and  men's  capacity  to  develop  their  personal  abilities, pursue their professional careers and make choices about their lives and life  plans. Harmful stereotypes can be both hostile/negative (e.g., women are irrational) or seemingly benign (e.g., women are nurturing).

are specific measurable objectives, with an aim to improve gender equality, that  are  set  by  an  organization  at  their  own  discretion,  with  discrete timeframes in which they are to be achieved.

is the term used to describe societies characterised by current and historic unequal  power  relations  between  women  and  men  whereby  women  are systematically disadvantaged, across various spheres of life but is particularly noticeable in women's  under-representation in key state institutions, in decision-making positions and in employment and industry. Male violence against women is also a key feature of patriarchy. Women in minority groups face multiple oppressions in this society, as race, class and sexuality intersect with sexism for example.

refer  to  data  that  are  collected  and  presented  separately  on  men  and women.

is a broad concept that refers to the constitution of an individual in relation to  sexual  attitudes  or  activity,  This  includes  aspects  of  the  physical, psychological, social, emotional, and spiritual makeup of an individual. It is not limited to the physical or biological reproductive elements and behavior, but  encompasses  the  manner  in  which  individuals  use  their  own  roles, relationships, values, customs, and gender.

refers  to  unwelcome  sexual  advances,  requests  for  sexual  favours,  and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature.

is the preferred term used when referring to an individual's physical and/or emotional attraction to the same and/or opposite gender.

- a  manifestation  of  the  historically  unequal  power  relations  between  men and women, which have led to domination over and discrimination against women by men and to the prevention of women's full advancement.

It  is  rooted in a belief that women are inferior, subordinate human beings whose  public  and  private  activities  should  be  determined,  monitored  or controlled by men.

## 1. Introduction

A Gender Policy has been drafted for The University of the West Indies (The UWI). The Policy meets the mandate outlined in the 2012-2017 Strategic Plan of The UWI ' to develop a gender policy for The UWI to create a supportive environment for both men and women in all aspects of university life; ' as part of the University's commitment to employee engagement and development. The Policy is intended to guide the University's actions to mainstream gender across the institution by ensuring gender equity in all University programmes, procedures and practices.

The UWI Gender Policy is premised - in large part - on this Situation Analysis, which outlines specific gaps and issues, which require attention; and which may be best addressed through a process of gender mainstreaming.

The  Situation  Analysis  employs  as  its  Conceptual  Framework  the Association  of  Commonwealth Universities' Gender  Measure, which  attempts  to  determine  the  extent  to  which  gender  has  been mainstreamed throughout the operations of tertiary-level institutions of learning.  The Gender Measure examines the number of female and male staff at different levels within higher education institutions, the existence of gender-related policies and activities within the university setting and perceptions of related provisions and practice    The Gender Measure Framework is based on four pillars: 4

- 1. Gender Figures

This examines gender parity and the extent to which parity is, or is not achieved, in staff recruitment and appointment; as well as in student enrolment and subject subscription.

- 2. Gender Mainstreaming Centres

This determines the existence of dedicated gender mainstreaming machinery within the respective university, which is equipped with the requisite technical expertise to facilitate the implementation of gender policies and strategies; and has been explicitly empowered by the university's management to do so.

- 3. Perspectives On Gender

This attempts to capture priority gender issues; within the respective university, which need to be addressed in the establishment of an enabling environment, which facilitates Gender Justice.

- 4. Gender Policies And Strategies

This examines the extent to which dedicated policies around issues of gender have been developed by the respective university; and are currently implemented

Based  on  a  consultative  process,  the  Situation  Analysis  presents  a  quantitative  and  qualitative assessment of the extent to which gender has been mainstreamed in UWI policies and procedures.

## 2. Gender Assessment of The UWI

## 2.1 Gender Figures

## 2.1.1 STUDENT ENROLMENT

The  Assessment  presents  figures  for  the  academic  years  2010  to  2015,  sourced  through  the University Office of Planning and Development's Statistical Digest.

The data reveal that all the faculties across The University of the West Indies (UWI) - with the exception of the Faculty of Engineering - have a predominately female student population; at both  the  undergraduate  and  graduate  levels.    The  most  significant  disparities  exist  in  the Faculties of Humanities &amp; Education and Social Sciences, where at least 70% of all students enrolled have been female for the period under review. Similar enrolment trends are observed in Institute for Gender and Development Studies (IGDS), where female enrolment has consistently been in excess of 75% of total enrolment.

Conversely, University-wide data show the Faculty of Engineering being consistently predominantly male, with male enrolment at an average of 63% for the academic years (AY) 2010, 2012 and 2014.

Of interest, the Faculty of Science and Technology was the only faculty in which enrolment was close to parity, with an average male and female enrolment rates of 47% and 52%, respectively for  the  academic  years  reviewed.    When  disaggregated  by  campus,  male  enrolment  actually surpassed  female  enrolment  in  the  Faculty  at  the  Cave  Hill  campus,  where  average  male enrolment  was  54%;  compared  to  average  female  enrolment  of  46%  over  the  2010  -  2015 periods.

It seems then, that while there is female advantage in overall University-wide enrolment, male students  typically  gravitate  to  the  more  critical  STEM  areas,  traditionally  regarded  as  male preserves. The movement by females into traditionally perceived male areas (such as Science and  Technology  and  Engineering)  has  not  been  replicated  by  male  students  moving  into traditionally  perceived  female  areas  of  study  (such  as  within  the  Faculty  of  Humanities  and Education or with the Institute for Gender and Development Studies).

While  the  observed  numerical  advantage  in  favour  of  females,  suggests  the  need  for  interventions towards greater enrolment parity, a focus solely on numerical advantage has the potential to mask the existence  of  a  broader  situation  that  is  indicative  of  deeper  systemic  issues,  which  threaten  the possibilities for Gender Justice at The UWI.

The consultations across the campuses revealed that despite the numerical advantage of female students patriarchal  ideologies  and  practices  persist,  which  run  counter  to  the  creation  of  an  of  an  enabling environment in which Gender Justice can be realised.

At St. Augustine it was noted that theft, assault, gender based violence, and sexual harassment continue to  be  areas  of  concern  for  students;  and  particularly  for  female  students.  The  case  of  construction workers working within the vicinity of the campus harassing female students was flagged as a serious concern, which received inadequate attention.   On the campus, female students reported being afraid to walk in dimly lit areas (many of which exist on the campus) at night for fear of being attacked.  Other crimes frequently reported to the estate police by female students included verbal abuse, intimidation, stalking and cyber stalking.

On the  Cave  Hill campus,  gender-based  violence,  sexual  harassment,  sexual  assault,  abuse (verbal,  physical  and  mental)  and  bullying  were  raised  as  issues  for  concern,  with  the  Security Forces  indicating    an  increasing  number  of  reports  of  violence  and  victimization  coming  from young women on the campus. In addition to Campus Security Services receiving official reports of various kinds of violence on the campus, anecdotal evidence points to a trend of under-reporting, where the official statistics may not be adequately reflective of the actual situation.  Notably, on the  Cave  Hill  campus,  victims  reported  discomfort  around  reporting  incidents  to  the  security forces;  as  they  believed  that  reporting  incidents  would  not  make  a  difference;  or  that  that  they would be re-victimized; or that the incident would become a source of personal embarrassment.

Similarly, on the Mona Campus, recent consultations around Safety and Sexual Health revealed a disconnect  between  the  official  statistics  and  anecdotal  data;  consequent  to  concerns  about  the confidentiality of the security system.  On the Mona Campus, it was felt that there exists on some Halls of Residence a pervasive culture of machismo and misogyny, which supports (and in many instances,  insists  on)  an  anti-diversity  culture.  Despite  attempts  by  some  Student  Services  and

Development  Managers  (SSDM)  to  create  a  more  inclusive  and  progressive  culture,  the involvement  of  alumni  students  in  the  activities  of  the  respective  Halls,  make  such  efforts challenging. In some instances, alumni students attempt to intimidate current students into holding onto antiquated ways of behaving, under the guise of tradition.

Importantly, the attitudes which drive these trends of under-reporting speak directly to the ways in which the environment The UWI's Sexual Harassment Policy attempts to facilitate has not been realised.

## Figure 1: Defining Sexual Harassment

## UWI Sexual Harassment Policy

The  Policy  describes  Sexual  harassment  as  a  form  of  misconduct,  which  includes  sexual advances, requests for sexual favours, and other similar verbal, non-verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature whether it is recurrent behaviour or a single incident and is made by a person, whether  male  or  female,  who  knows  or  ought  reasonably  to  know  that  such  behaviour  is unwanted  by  the  person  to  whom  the  conduct  is  directed;  and  where  such  conduct  has  the purpose or effect of interfering with an individual's personal safety, work or academic performance; or [which] creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive living, working or academic environment; [where] submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition  of  an  individual's  personal  safety,  employment  status,  academic  status  or  academic achievement and certification; and [where] rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the  basis  for  adverse  personal  safety,  employment,  or  academic  achievement  and  certification decisions affecting such individual…. rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for adverse personal safety, employment, or academic achievement and certification decisions affecting such individual.

Considered collectively, the student enrolment data seem to suggest the need for interventions to ensure:

-  improved diversity in student enrolment, retention and performance
-  reduced  sex-differentiation  in  Faculty  and  subject  subscription;  through  -  inter  alia  -  a revision of syllabi content and pedagogy to address gender gaps to ensure that all programs create equally engaged learners
-  The  UWI  offers  relevant  and  attractive  courses  for  all  potential  learners,  irrespective  of categories of difference including but not limited to sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity,  ability/disability,  religion,  age,  socio-economic  status,  nationality  or  place  of origin.

## 2.1.2 STAFF RECRUITMENT and PROMOTION 

When examined on the basis of function and hierarchy consistent patterns emerged among staff at The UWI:

-  female staff dominate in the Senior, Professional and Administrative categories

-  female staff are clustered at the lower scale of academic staff
-  male staff dominate in Senior Academic and Managerial positions.

##  CAVE HILL CAMPUS

Data for the Cave Hill Campus were unique in that for the periods under consideration, collectively, male staff consistently outnumbered female staff in each category, with the exception of Senior, Administrative and Professional Staff.

When data were disaggregated on the basis of hierarchy, males dominated in every academic category, save Assistant  Lecturer .  The  disparity  was  most  pronounced  in  the Senior  Lecturer and  Professorial categories, which saw male employees occupying at least 70% of these positions.

Interestingly,  despite  male  dominance  at  the  lower  levels  of  staff,  80%  of  the  Campus  Management Team was female.

##  MONA CAMPUS

Data for the Mona Campus presented trends opposite to those observed at the Cave Hill Campus. At Mona, female staff dominated in all categories, save Service Staff, which would comprise the Maintenance  Department,  where  male  staff  dominate.    Also  unlike  the  Cave  Hill  Campus Management Team, which comprised 80% female members of staff, 88% of the Mona Campus Management Team is male.

Of note, near parity was observed in the Fixed Term Contract and Professional Staff categories.

In the Academic Staff category, however similar trends to the Cave Hill campus were observed. As on the Cave Hill campus, female members of staff  remained clustered at the lower levels ( Research  Assistant,  Instructor,  Assistant  Lecturer  and  Lecturer) and  male  members  of  staff dominated at the higher levels, most notably in the Professorial category, where more than twice as many Professors were male than female.

##  ST. AUGUSTINE CAMPUS

As the largest campus of The University of West Indies, the St. Augustine campus staff has been growing  steadily.  For  the  AY  2015/16  Staff  data  trends  on  the  campus  were  similar  to  those observed on the Mona Campus, where female staff dominated in total figures.

There were three categories in which more male staff members were employed than female staff members: Academics, ATS (Service) and ATS (Technical)

Table 5:   Staff Distribution by Sex, St. Augustine Campus (AY 2015/2016)

|                             | Male   | Male   | Female   | Female   | Totals   |

| Academic Staff              | 1402   | 53%    | 1260     | 47%      | 2662     |
| Academic Support Staff      | 826    | 34%    | 1584     | 66%      | 2410     |
| ATS (Administrative) Staff  | 288    | 20%    | 1180     | 80%      | 1468     |
| ATS (Service) Staff         | 392    | 57%    | 298      | 43%      | 690      |
| ATS (Technical) Staff       | 368    | 56%    | 284      | 44%      | 652      |
| Professional Staff          | 114    | 48%    | 122      | 52%      | 236      |
| Senior Administrative Staff | 46     | 35%    | 86       | 65%      | 132      |
| TOTAL                       | 3436   | 42%    | 4814     | 58%      | 8250     |

Like the Cave Hill and Mona Campuses, when data were disaggregated on the basis of hierarchy, in every category, other than Assistant Lecturer males dominated. Again, the disparity was most pronounced in the Senior Lecturer and Professorial categories, which saw in the former instance almost twice as many male than female employees; and in the latter almost four times as many male than female employees.

Figure 3: Distribution of Academic Staff by Sex and Hierarchy (St. Augustine Campus)

Across the physical campuses, staff data point to sex segregation of occupations, particularly at the  higher  levels  of  the  institution,  which  remains  dominated  by  men.  The  disparity  is  most pronounced at the Professorial and Management Levels.

The  data  are  supported  by  the  2011  Wint  and  Iton  authored  report A  Review  of  Professorial Promotions [1995  -  2010]  (BUS.P.20  2010/2011) ,  which  examines,  inter  alia,  the  gender 5 distribution of successful professorial applicants for the period 1995 to 2010 within three time blocks: 1995 -1999; 2000-2004; and 2005-2010; and which notes that:

after improving between the first and second time blocks, the gender ratio [of male to female professors] has shown no improvement, and indeed a marginal decline.

Notably absent from the Report, however are recommendations to resolve the wide disparities that exist at this level. This absence is of concern, given findings from a 2007 Gender Audit of The  UWI  (Mona  Campus),  which  sought  to  capture  the  qualitative  experiences  of  staff  (and students) on the campus from a gendered perspective.  Findings from the Report noted (that):

-  the  existence  of  male  networks  as  the  reasons  for  which  male  employees  were  more likely to enjoy greater opportunity for upward mobility.
-  decisions  are  made  over  drinks  or  other  forms  of  socializing…  and  personality  is considered a plus over performance.
-  it  is  easier for males to abscond from competing responsibilities (especially family) to focus on work.
-  The UWI tends to have a mindset of male dominance and feels that the man should be the leader in all areas of its administration. This has always been the trend.
-  there appears to be a 'glass ceiling' culture with a preference towards male leadership with only few women in top positions.

Subsequent work completed by Leo-Rhynie in 2008 , which presented an analysis of workplace 6 and educational opportunities for women throughout the history of The University of the West Indies noted that while there have been improvements in the rank of female academics, women are  disproportionately  clustered  in  the  junior  positions.  Leo-Rhynie's  work  also  explored  the need for policy interventions to allow women to advance in the institution.

Towards that end, The UWI Gender Policy mandates The UWI administration to:

-  seek to improve the sex ratio (towards parity) which currently exists in staff recruitment, training, promotion and recognition at all levels, across all categories of staff, with a focus on the recruitment, retention and promotion of qualified members of staff, irrespective of categories of difference including but not limited to sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity,  ability/disability,  religion,  age,  socio-economic  status,  nationality  or  place of origin.
-  consider  issues  of  equity  by  taking  deliberate  action  to  improve  the  quality  of  working conditions to enhance employee engagement and to promote work/life balance, towards the creation of engaged employees; including the right to reproductive and childcare support and  facilities  for  staff,  including  but  not  limited  to  and  child  friendly  infrastructure  and facilities
-  deliberately facilitate and increase participation by women in positions of leadership and decision-making.
-  create and sustain an enabling environment in which all members of staff are equally able to advance through the hierarchy on the basis of merit; as well as an environment in which executive decisions are made in the spirit of the Mission and Vision of The UWI Gender Policy, i.e.  towards the creation of Gender Justice.
-  identify and address all biases that exist in its organizational culture that do not promote, support or enable gender equity and justice.

## 2.2 Gender Mainstreaming Centres

While  The  University  of  the  West  Indies  does  not  have  dedicated  Gender  Mainstreaming machinery; and despite persistent gaps, The University of the West Indies must be congratulated for  its  recognition  of  gender  as  central  to  the  success  of  its  operations;  and  a  key  to  its sustainability, as most recently evidenced through its commitment within the current Strategic Framework to develop a Gender Policy.

Historically, The University of the West Indies (UWI) has concerned itself with issues of Gender Justice. From its inception, the founders of The UWI were careful to include in the Report of the West Indies Committee of the Commission on Higher Education in the Colonies, (The  Irvine Committee Report 7 of June 1945), its recommendations that in its establishment, the University College of the West Indies (the predecessor of The UWI)

should  be  open  to  women  on  precisely  the  same  terms  and  conditions  as  are applicable  to  men.    Similarly,  no  restriction  should  be  imposed  on  grounds  of race or creed…

The establishment of the Centre for Gender and Development Studies (CGDS) in 1993, which emerged  out  of  eleven  years  of  lobbying,  staff  development  and  preliminary  teaching  by members of the Women and Development Studies Groups (WDSG), which operated across the three campuses (Mona, Cave Hill and St. Augustine) is a testament to The UWI's concern with issues  of  gender.    A  1984  Concept  Paper,  outlining  the  objectives  of  the  Women  and Development Studies Groups, lists as its objective:

…to generate knowledge and to disseminate information, historical and contemporary, on the position of women with special reference to the Caribbean… The intention is to restructure existing knowledge within the disciplines so that people will be better equipped to engage in the process of social change.

Professor Elsa Leo-Rhynie, former University Director of the CGDS, in her 2003 CGDS 10th Anniversary  Keynote  Address,  entitled  Gender  Studies:  Crossing  Boundaries,  Charting  New Directions, notes:

The Centre for Gender and Development Studies was established within The UWI system  in  September  1993  with  units  on  all  three  campuses  and  a  regional coordinating unit on the Mona Campus.

Its  establishment  was  the  result  of  11  previous  years  of  active  lobbying,  pilot teaching, strategising, training and early research and publication by members of the Women and Development Studies groups on the three campuses of The UWI… The work of the WDS groups served as a catalyst for the penetration of academia and for the exciting and dynamic growth of scholarship in the area of gender and development in the region. 8

Congruent  with  the  vision  of  the  WDSG,  the  Centre  for  Gender  and  Development  Studies (CGDS) was established as a multi-disciplinary department of The University of the West Indies (UWI) engaged in teaching, research, outreach and publication on current and emerging issues on gender and development at the local, regional and international levels.

## Leo-Rhynie also notes that:

From the outset,  it  was  clearly  established  that  not  only  was  Gender  Studies  a new academic pursuit in relation to  The UWI experience but that it transcends and  transgresses  disciplinary  boundaries  and  therefore  brings  with  it  new epistemological, pedagogical and organizational challenges.

Most notably, in order to facilitate the richness and the unique academic rigour afforded by an inter  and  multi-disciplinary  perspective,  the  CGDS  was  deliberately  designed  outside  of  the traditional UWI faculty structure.

Another significant milestone, occurred in 2008, with the decision by the University Finance and General Purposes Committee (F&amp;GPC) on October 10, 2008 to approve the re-designation of the Centre  for  Gender  and  Development  Studies to  an  Institute  of  the  University,  in  response  to lobbying  efforts  to  recognize  that,  the  Centre,  through  its  schedule  of  teaching,  research  and outreach, had historically operated as an Institute.  The re-designation was formally announced on  February  27,  2009  with  the  Centre  being  renamed as The  Institute of Gender  and Development Studies.

Since  its  establishment,  the  collective  work  of  the  Institute  has  both  assisted  in  generating knowledge  towards  an  understanding  of  our  Caribbean  realities  and  created  directed  regional policy towards social transformation. The IGDS has addressed and continues to shed light on a multiplicity  of  issues  and  social  concerns;  and  the  ways  in  which  gender  inequalities  keep women and other vulnerable groups subordinated and denied the opportunity of realizing their true potential.

The teaching, research and advocacy of the IGDS have collectively gone a long way in ensuring that  the  ideal  UWI  graduate  not  only  has  a  desire  for  knowledge,  strong  critical  thinking  and problem-solving skills, but also competence in interdisciplinary gender analysis that will enable her/him  to  question  historically  accepted  and  contemporary  theories  and  explanations  about society.

Moreover, the work of the IGDS has equipped a cadre of men and women in the Caribbean and beyond,  with  the  tools  and  frameworks  to  challenge  social  inequity  and  social  and  gender injustice everywhere.

In  addition  to  the  continued  and  increased  resource  support  to  the  Institute  for  Gender  and Development  Studies,  The  UWI  Gender  Policy  requires  the  establishment  of  a  Gender Mainstreaming Committee (GMC), to be established centrally within the University and guided by a clearly articulated and documented Terms of Reference.

With expert advice from the IGDS, it is expected that the GMC will:

-  champion Gender Justice across the University; and engage in University-wide activities intended to positively shape attitudes towards Gender Justice
-  advocate for and drive the Gender Mainstreaming processes of The UWI Gender Policy

-  complete  research  in  relation  to  issues  of  gender  across  the  University,  toward  the monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of The UWI Gender Policy
-  develop  terms  of  reference  for  the  establishment  of  Campus  Gender  Action  Plans  in collaboration with respective Campus Registrars and Gender Task Forces
-  work with the Gender Task Force on each campus towards the implementation of  The UWI Gender Policy
-  receive and address complaints in relation to non-compliance

## The GMC will be comprised of:

-  a Chairperson, to be appointed by the Vice Chancellor
-  The UWI Registrar
-  external Experts, who will assume responsibilities for the development of the Monitoring and Evaluation Framework for the Policy:
-  Gender Mainstreaming Expert
-  Monitoring and Evaluation Expert
-  heads  of  the  Campus  Gender  Task  Force,  to  be  appointed  by  the  respective  Campus Registrars
-  one representative from the Guild of students
-  one representative from the IGDS, appointed by the IGDS University Director

## 2.3 Perspectives on Gender

The  consultative  process  across  the  physical  campuses  highlighted  several  issues  in  need  of attention, in the instance that The UWI Gender Policy would find an environment conducive for its success.  These included:

-  curriculum development
-  student enrollment and performance
-  creating a safe and secure environment
-  staff and student welfare
-  staffing recruitment training and advancement
-  decision making structures

## 2.3.1 Curriculum and Programme Development

A  University's  curriculum  has  the  opportunity  to  integrate  coherent  learning  experiences  for students  that  reflect  the  university's  principles  enshrined  in  its  policies  and  procedures.    The realities engendering the lives of men and women not only shape the lives of students; but have gender implication  that  if  not  addressed  can  hinder  gender  equality  and  justice.    Towards  the achievement of Gender Justice throughout the University, a gender responsive curriculum that promotes  equality  and  equity  must  be  developed.    Three  recommendations  were  offered  in relation to ways of mainstreaming gender throughout the University's curriculum:

-  The UWI Centre for Excellence in Teaching and Learning  (CETL) can be used to: 9
-  champion the integration of gender perspectives in teaching and learning,
-  develop  sensitivity  training  to  facilitate  LGBT  persons  and  other  vulnerable communities in the classroom.
-  develop a gender mainstreaming module to be incorporated in research trainings including gender sensitive guidelines for publications.
-  establish  a  gender  equality  unit  to  ensure  gender  analysis  is  integrated  into  all programmes and studies.
-  promote gender equality in all research and innovation initiatives
-  The introduction of Gender Foundation Courses ( Gender 101 ) could be used to expose all UWI students to critical ideas of gender and gender relations.
-  The First-Year Experience Programmes across the University could be used to not only expose  first  year  students  to  issues  of  diversity  and  tolerance,  but  to  do  so  within  the context of gender.

## 2.3.2 Student Enrolment and Performance

Considered  collectively,  student  enrolment  data  across  the  University  suggest  disheartening gender trends, where traditionally held stereotypes about particular academic disciplines seem to persist.

In  an  effort  for  The  UWI  to  offer  relevant  and  attractive  courses  for  all  potential  learners, irrespective of categories of difference, the following recommendations are offered:

-  identify differential  gender issues  affecting male and  female performance and establish mechanisms to mitigate these issues to assist in improving student performance.
-  reduce  Sex-differentiation  in  Faculty  and  subject  subscription;  through  -  inter  alia  -  a revision  of  syllabi  content  and  pedagogy  to  address  gender  gaps  to  ensure  that  all programs create equally engaged learners
-  develop outreach strategies to attract male students into traditionally perceived feminine areas (such as the Humanities and Gender and Development Studies); and attract female students into the STEM areas, traditionally perceived as a male preserve.
-  review  and  assess  the  enrollment  rate  of  disadvantaged  students  and  persons  with disabilities including the challenges they face; and establish a minimum  annual enrollment rate with measures to support their campus experience.

## 2.3.3 Creating a Safe Environment for The UWI Community

The safety and security of staff, students and visiting members of the University is vital to the well-being of all, to facilitate a conducive environment for learning and productivity. Despite the existence  of  Campus  Security  Units  on  the  respective  campuses,  theft,  assault,  gender-based violence, and sexual harassment remain as areas of concern for students and staff.

Students assigned to off-campus housing, and particularly international students, continue to be of concern, as their vulnerability to violations in these areas is increased; but are hey unable to access campus security for support.

The situation is compounded further as victims of violations (both on and off of the respective campuses) do not feel comfortable reporting so they try to adapt to get out of the situation. One of  the  barriers  is  that  people  feel  reporting  will  not  make  a  difference,  that  they  will  be  revictimized or the incident will become a source of embarrassment to them.

Recommendations  towards  ensuring  that  a  safe,  secure,  healthy  and  enabling  working  and learning environment is created across The UWI, which takes into consideration the cultural and religious diversity of the University and it's international population all students, include:

-  sensitizing all campus employees, staff and students including construction workers on UWI's Policy's on Gender and Sexual Harassment.
-  strengthening The UWI Policy of Gender and Sexual Harassment policy to:
-  ensure reported cases are thoroughly investigated prior to retraction.
-  develop appropriate strategies to enhance confidentiality, including the education and publicizing the sexual harassment policy to all employees, staff and students
-  updating  reporting  systems  to  be  electronic  and  online;  and  train  and  equip  security personnel to use the requisite technology to immediately enter information, which then becomes  immediately  accessible  to  the  entire  network  of  personnel  involved  in  the provision of security and intervention services; and becomes part of a security data base, to which only personnel with security clearance have access.
-  collecting  data  on  incidents  of  violence  disaggregated  by  age,  status,  nationality  and immigration (i.e. familiarity with the campus, country and services), role on campus, and gender
-  identifying  and  assigning  dedicated  Safe  Spaces  to  students  more  vulnerable  to  having their health and safety compromised; E.g. consequent to their expressed sexuality
-  close  the  gap  in  provision  for  students  and  staff  who  are  transgender  and  intersex. Facilities such as single-stall or gender-neutral bathrooms and other resources might be considered.

## 2.3.4 Staffing recruitment training and advancement

Staff  employment  data  and  perceptions  of  staff  across  the  University  is  both  instructive  and indicative  that  intervention  is  required  towards  institutionalising  a  gender  responsive  human resource modality for all employees and staff. Towards this end, recommendations include:

-  mainstreaming gender into the current Human Resource policy as well as guidelines rules and regulations
-  establishing  explicit  and  documented  guidelines  to  ensure  the  recruitment  and  career advancement  opportunities,  including  promotions  are  competency  based,  with  gender equality and justice as an underlying principle.
-  examining recent promotion and staffing trends with a gender lens, to assess the extent to which where both sexes are competent, promotion standards are fair. In some instances Affirmative  Recruitment  may  have  to  be  considered  to  address  traditionally  accepted gender gaps.
-  offering mandatory gender sensitive training for all employees and staff
-  establishing  gender  sensitive  staff  training  protocol  for  academic  advancement  and capacity building.

## 2.3.5 Decision-making structures

Given the pronounced gender disparity within the decision-making structures across The UWI, in  order  to  develop  a  framework  for  equal  participation  the  following  recommendations  are offered:

-  Assess  all  governing,  decision  making  bodies  and  committees  and  develop  a  gender sensitive and equitable representation
-  Administer a gender sensitive leadership training programme for all staff
-  Institute a temporary affirmative action modality to bridge the gap of unequal representation in current decision making bodies
-  Develop  a  transformational  leadership  mentorship  programme  for  younger  male  and female staff as a means of building a gender sensitive cadre of staff members to assume future decision-making positions.
-  Train  personnel  within  various  relevant  offices  (the  University  Counsel,  the  Office  of Administration, the University Librarian) to ensure all university documents are gender sensitive.

## 2.4 Gender Policies and Strategies

Under its Charter of Establishment, the instruments through which The UWI (including its Mona Campus) is governed are its:

-  Statutes and Ordinances
-  Rules and Regulations
-  Faculty Standing Orders
-  Financial Code

More specifically, towards its commitment to enhance every aspect of Caribbean development and  improve  the  well-being  of  the  people  of  the  Caribbean,  through  excellence  in  teaching, research, innovation, public service, intellectual leadership and outreach, University is guided by its mission, vision and core values, which are, respectively:

## Mission

To advance learning, create knowledge and foster innovation for the positive transformation of the Caribbean and the wider world

## Vision

An excellent global university rooted in the Caribbean

## Core Values

The Core Values of The UWI that guide its policy and decision making and provide the foundation for directing the University's mandate, efforts, resources and conduct, are:

- 1. Integrity
- 2. Excellence
- 3. Gender Justice
- 4. Diversity
- 5. Student Centredness

Since 1997, the operations of The UWI have been guided by various Five-year Strategic Plans, which  were  developed  pursuant  to  The  UWI  10-year  Development  Plan  for  the  1990's.

Additionally, The University of the West Indies is guided by various policies 10 , which inform its day to day operations in relation to various and specific aspects of its functioning.  These include:

- 1. Acceptable Use Policy: Information &amp; Communication Technology
- 2. Health and Wellness Policy
- 3. Policy on Intellectual Property
- 4. Policy on HIV/AIDS
- 5. Policy on Sexual Harassment
- 6. ICT Security Policy
- 7. A Policy on Intellectual Property Management and Commercialisation
- 8. Policy on Research Ethics
- 9. Social Media Policy
- 10. Policy for Online, Distance and Multimode Learning

Of note, of the policies listed, two - the Policy on HIV/AIDS and the Policy on Sexual Harassment - explicitly articulate principles of gender equality.

Figure 4: Gender Related Issues: UWI HIV/AIDS Policy

## UWI HIV/AIDS Policy

The  University  is  committed  to  providing  an  environment  in  which  the equality of men and women is respected, where neither sexist behaviour nor  gender-based  discrimination  is  countenanced  and  in  which  proactive attention is given to protecting all students from coercive sex. The University also recognizes its responsibility to provide its male and female students and staff with such gender-sensitive programmes as will ensure that they are aware not only of the rights and vulnerabilities of others,  but  also  of  the  HIV/AIDS  related  implications  of  sexual  abuse

and violence, which affect women predominantly.

In  general  terms,  however  The  UWI  policy  framework  is  currently  gender-blind,  not  even requiring gender-sensitivity from the distinctive UWI graduate (as articulated in the 2007 - 2012 Strategic Plan).

Figure 5: The Distinctive UWI Graduate

## The Distinctive UWI Graduate

The distinctive UWI graduate is expected only to be a critical and creative thinker; an effective communicator with good interpersonal skills; ITskilled and information literate; innovative and entrepreneurial; globally aware and  well-grounded in  his/her  regional  identity; socially,  culturally  and environmentally  responsible;  and  guided  by  strong ethical values.

The  omission  is  a  serious  one  when  one  considers  that  if  the  University's  policy  framework, which is used to guide practice, is silent on the matter of gender, the University's programmes and procedures cannot be implemented with any clear objectives towards  the incorporation of gender issues and ultimately cannot support or facilitate gender justice.

The  current  policy  framework  seems  in  contradiction  to  the  intentions  of  the  University's founders, who were careful to include in the Irvine Report of 1945, its recommendations that in its establishment, the University College of the West Indies (the predecessor of The UWI) should uphold principles of gender justice.

## 3. Mainstreaming the Policy Framework

Within the context of the current UWI Policy Framework, The UWI Gender Policy is intended to guide The UWI's actions to mainstream gender across the institution by ensuring gender equity in all University practices, policies, procedures and programmes.

Critically,  the  development  of  The  UWI  Gender  Policy  will  ensure  that  The  UWI  as  an institution is:

-  operating  within  best  practices  for  tertiary  institutions,  where  steps  have  been  taken  to ensure that gender justice is promoted and championed at all levels; and that all systems of  governance,  official  documents,  policies,  procedures,  curriculum  development  and pedagogy are gender sensitive;
-  aligned to and compliant with international, regional and national protocols including to promote gender justice; which all Caribbean countries have ratified.

When  implemented,  The  UWI  Gender  Policy  will  embed  strategies  to  address  existing  and potential  disparities,  and  offer  alternatives  to  attitudes  and  systemic  practices  that  reinforce gender prejudice, stereotyping, harassment, gender based violence and discrimination.

The UWI Gender Policy will serve all members of The UWI community in equally accessing gender justice.
