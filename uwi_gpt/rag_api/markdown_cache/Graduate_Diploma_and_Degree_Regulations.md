Where a candidate dies after submission but prior to forwarding of the thesis, research paper or project report for examination, the Campus Registrar shall in all cases inform the examiners of the status of the candidate.  Where the examiners require only editorial changes, the Campus Committee may authorize the  candidate's  Supervisor  to  effect  such  changes.    Where examiners require substantive  changes,  the  matter  shall  be referred to the Board for Graduate Studies and Research for determination.
- 84. Where a candidate dies after examiners have reported, but prior  to  completing  required  corrections,  the  procedure  at Regulation 83 shall apply with respect to the required changes.

## CHEATING

- 85. Cheating is any attempt to benefit oneself or another by deceit or fraud.  Plagiarism is a form of cheating.  Plagiarism is the unauthorized and unacknowledged use of another person's intellectual efforts, ideas and creations under one's own name howsoever recorded, including whether formally published or in manuscript or in typescript or other printed or electronically presented form.  Plagiarism includes taking passages, ideas or structures from another work or author without attribution of such source(s), using the conventions for attributions or citing used in this University.   Since any piece of work submitted by a  student  must  be  that  student's  own  work,  all  forms  of cheating, including plagiarism,  are forbidden.

86.

- (a) If any candidate is suspected of plagiarism in a thesis, research  paper,  project  report  or  course-work assignment,  the  circumstances  shall  be  reported  in writing to the Campus Registrar. The Campus Registrar shall refer the matter to the Board for Graduate Studies and Research.  If the Chair so decides, the Board shall invite the candidate for an interview and shall conduct an  investigation.    If  the  candidate  fails  to  attend  the interview, and does not offer a satisfactory excuse, the Board may hear the case in the candidate's absence. If the candidate is found guilty of plagiarism, the Board for Graduate Studies and Research shall fail the candidate and may, subject to the candidate's right of appeal to Senate, exclude him or her from all further examinations of the University.
- (b) Appeals against decisions of the Board for Graduate Studies  and  Research  shall  be  heard  by  an  Appeal Committee of Senate. Such an Appeal Committee may uphold or reverse the decision and may vary the penalty in either direction within the limits prescribed in (a) above. The decision of the Appeal Committee of Senate shall be final.

## SECTION 3

## REGULATIONS FOR THE EXAMINATION OF RESEARCH PAPERS, PROJECT REPORTS AND THESES

## APPOINTMENT OF EXAMINERS

- 1. All examiners shall be appointed by the Campus Committee on behalf of the Board for Graduate Studies and Research, on the recommendation of the relevant Head of Department.
- 2. For all theses, and for all research papers and project reports contributing more than 25% of the programme credit rating, at  least  three  examiners  shall  be  appointed,  one  of  whom shall be external.
- 3. For each research paper, project report or thesis, one of the examiners  shall  be  the  Supervisor,  unless  the  Board  for Graduate Studies and Research in any particular case otherwise decides.
- 4. For oral examinations, and for practical or written tests required by examiners after reading theses, research papers or project reports,  the  examiners  shall    be  the  same  persons  initially appointed  by  the  Campus  Committee,  but  the  Board  for Graduate Studies and Research may, at its discretion, appoint examiners specifically for oral examinations.
- 5. Examiners  shall  be  nominated  by  the  relevant  Head  of Department at least three months before the proposed date of submission for theses, and at least two months before the proposed date of submission for research papers and project

reports.  Heads of Departments are required to submit the names of nominated Examiners to the Campus Committee, and to advise Internal Examiners of their nomination, in writing.

- 6. The  Campus  Registrar  shall  inform  Examiners  of  their appointment by the Campus Committee.

## EXAMINATION OF RESEARCH PAPERS AND PROJECT REPORTS

- 7. The regulations applicable to examination of theses shall not apply to examination of research papers or project reports which constitute 25% or less of the programme credit rating. These shall be examined as follows:
- (a) Research papers or project reports shall be assigned a mark  by  each  Internal  Examiner  who  shall  report individually on his or her assessment of the work.  Should the marks differ substantially, the agreed mark will be mediated by the Campus Committee in accordance with the Manual of Procedures for Graduate Diplomas and Degrees.
- (b) Candidates shall not be required to make corrections to research papers or project reports before the award of a  final  grade,  except  in  instances  where  minor corrections would enable a marginal failure (45-49%) to be awarded the minimum passing mark (50%).
- (c ) A research paper or project report which has been failed by the examiners will be allowed only one re-submission. The re-submission must be within a six month period following initial notification of the failure.  Re-submitted research papers or project reports will only receive the minimum passing mark (50%).
- (d) Research papers or project reports assigned an A grade shall be lodged in the Campus Library.  Research papers or project reports assigned a lesser grade may also be

- (e) Candidates  may  be  required  to  make  corrections  to research papers or project reports to be lodged in the Campus Library  to  ensure  that  such  work  reaches acceptable standards of presentation.  Such corrections shall not alter the final grade assigned.
- 8. Research  papers  or  project  reports  for  which  the  credit weighting is greater than 25% shall be examined as a thesis, but a grade and mark shall be assigned.  Such project reports and research papers will be simultaneously examined by all examiners, who will each submit a report, a grade and a mark. The  grade  and  mark  awarded  by  an  examiner  may  be contingent on revisions suggested by the examiner being made to  the  satisfaction  of  the  student's  Supervisor.    Should  the marks of examiners differ substantially, the agreed mark will be mediated by the Campus Committee in accordance with the Manual of Procedures for Graduate Diplomas and Degrees.

## EXAMINATION OF THESES

## Entry for Examination by Thesis

- 9. The candidate must apply to enter for the examination by thesis on the appropriate entry form not less than three months before the expected date of submission of the thesis.  The application must be accompanied by the required examination fee.
- 10. The candidate must submit the entry form for examination by thesis to the Campus Registrar through the Supervisor who shall indicate his or her approval by signing a Certificate of Completion  of  Study  Form.  In  signing  a  Certificate  of Completion of Study Form, the Supervisor will be required to separately address (a) The integrity of the thesis, i.e. whether, to the best of his or her knowledge, the work in the thesis was

- conducted by the student, and (b) The academic content and technical  presentation  of  the  thesis,  i.e.  whether,  in  the Supervisor's opinion, the thesis is ready for examination.
- 11 If the Supervisor has concerns about the integrity of the thesis, he or she shall so indicate to the Campus Registrar in writing, and  the  Campus  Committee  shall  establish  a  Review Committee to assess the concern.  In such circumstances, the Review Committee will make a recommendation to the Board for Graduate Studies and Research on the admissibility of the thesis for examination.
- 12. If, in the opinion of the Supervisor, the academic content or technical presentation of the thesis is such that the thesis is not ready for examination, he or she shall so indicate to the Campus Registrar  and  the  candidate  in  writing.    In  such circumstances,  the  Campus  Committee  will  meet  with interested  parties  who  may  include  the  candidate,  the Supervisor, the student's Committee of Advisors, the relevant Head of Department or, if the Head is Supervisor, the relevant Faculty Dean. Should the consensus from the meetings be that the thesis is not yet suitable for examination, the student should be informed and counselled.  Should the student insist on submitting the thesis for examination in the present form, the Board for Graduate Studies and Research may decide that it is appropriate to submit a report of the Campus Committee's deliberations to the Examiners.
- 13. When a thesis  is  submitted  for  examination  without  the Supervisor's approval, the Supervisor will be exempted from examining the candidate by the Board for Graduate Studies and Research.
- 14. A candidate must submit for the  approval  of  the  Campus Committee, the exact title of his or her thesis at the time when he or she applies for entry to the examination.  An approved thesis title may not be changed except with the permission of the Campus Committee.

- 15. Five copies of the thesis for examination shall be submitted to the Campus Registrar.
- 16. Candidates will be required to present themselves for any oral, practical or written examination at such place as the University may direct, upon such day or days as shall be notified to the candidates by the Campus Registrar in writing.
- 17. A candidate for a graduate degree examined by thesis may not  submit  the  thesis  for  examination  on  more  than  two occasions, and in any case, must submit the thesis within the time  limits  imposed  for  the  particular  degree  (see  General Regulations for Graduate Diplomas and Degrees 55, 56, 58, 59).

## Form of Submission of Theses

- 18. Requirements for the presentation of theses are set out in the Thesis Guide published by the Board for Graduate Studies and Research.  Theses which are not presented in accordance with  the  provisions  of  the  Guide  will  not  be  sent  for examination.

## Examination Procedures for These s

- 19. MPhil, MD and PhD degrees are examined primarily by thesis, but candidates are required to satisfy the Examiners in such oral,  practical  or  written  examinations  as  stipulated  by  the Board for  Graduate  Studies  and  Research  and  in  Faculty Regulations.
- 20. Subject to Regulations 24-26, the Examiners of a PhD thesis shall, after reading the thesis, examine the candidate orally and  may,  at  their  discretion,  also  examine  the  candidate practically or by written questions or by both of these methods.
- 21. If  an  Examiner of an MPhil or MD thesis deems the thesis generally  adequate  but  wishes  to  explore  the  candidate's knowledge of the field  of  study  further,  the  Examiner  may require that the candidate be examined orally, practically, or by written papers, or by both of these methods.

- 22. Examiners of theses are required to report to the Board for Graduate Studies and Research, through the Campus Registrar, within two months of receipt of a thesis.  The report shall contain:
- (a) An evaluation of the thesis;
- (b) A recommendation in accordance with Regulations 20-27;
- (c ) An indication of any changes in the thesis which the Examiner thinks should be made before the award of the degree.

The Examiners may also  recommend the  award  of  high commendation.

- 23. If, in the opinion of the Examiners, an MPhil thesis is of such high standard and potential that it might be developed into a submission  for  the  PhD  degree,  the  Examiners  may recommend to the Board for Graduate Studies and Research that the candidate be permitted to transfer registration to the PhD, but it shall be the right of the candidate at any time to accept conferment of the Master's degree.
- 24. If, in the opinion of the Examiners, a PhD thesis is of insufficient merit to justify the award of the Ph.D. degree, the Examiners may,  without  further  test,  recommend  to  the  Board  for Graduate Studies and Research that the candidate be permitted to resubmit the thesis with revision for the M.Phil degree, or that the MPhil be awarded without further revision of the work.
- 25. The Examiners may, without further test, recommend that a thesis be rejected.  A candidate whose thesis is rejected by the Board for Graduate Studies and Research after it has received reports from all of the Examiners, shall not be permitted to present the same thesis for examination, or a revised version of  the  thesis  with  the  same  title,  unless  re-approval  of candidature  has  been  granted  by  the  Board  for  Graduate Studies and Research.

- 26. If, in the opinion of the Examiners, the thesis is inadequate, but  of  sufficient  merit  to  justify  a  second  attempt  at  the examination,  the  Examiners  may,  without  further  test, recommend to the Board for Graduate Studies and Research that  the  candidate  be  permitted  to  resubmit  the  thesis  for examination in a revised form.  A candidate who is required by the Examiners to make such major changes to the thesis and to resubmit the thesis in a revised form for examination, must  resubmit  within  eighteen  months  of  the  date  of notification.    The  Campus  Committee  shall  send  to  the candidate pertinent comments of the Examiners relating to the changes they propose.
- 27. If, in the opinion of the Examiners, the thesis is adequate but defective in ways which do not require it to be resubmitted for examination, they may require the candidate to make such amendments to the thesis as will remove the defects indicated before the award of the degree. Subject to Regulation 28, such changes shall be made after the oral examination for Ph.D. candidates. A candidate who is required by the Examiners to make such amendments to the thesis must do so within a period of six months after the date of notification.  The Campus Committee shall specify how these changes are to be made. If the candidate fails to make the alterations required by the Examiners to the satisfaction of the student's Supervisor and the Campus Committee within that period, and is not granted an extension, he or she will be deemed to have failed the examination.
- 28. If the reports of the Examiners indicate that a thesis requires extensive revision, but not re-submission in accordance with Regulation 26, the Chairman of the Board for Graduate Studies and Research may, at his or her discretion, direct that the candidate  be  requested  to  satisfactorily  effect  such  revision prior  to  any  oral  examination  of  the  candidate,  and  such revision should be completed within twelve months of the date of notification.
- 29. If, in the opinion of the Examiners, the thesis is adequate but the candidate fails to satisfy the Examiners at the oral, practical,

- or  written  examination  held  in  connection  therewith,  the Examiners may recommend to the Board for Graduate Studies and Research that the candidate be permitted to submit to a further oral, practical or written examination within a period not exceeding eighteen months from the decision of the Board for Graduate Studies and Research.
- 30. If, in the opinion of the Examiners, the thesis is adequate, and if the candidate satisfies the Examiners in any oral, practical or  written  examination  required,  the  Examiners  shall recommend to the Board for Graduate Studies and Research that the degree be conferred.  Where Examiners recommend conferment of the degree, they are required to certify that the thesis is worthy of publication as a thesis approved for the degree of Master of Philosophy (MPhil), Doctor of Medicine (MD) or Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) of the University of the West Indies.
- 31. Oral examinations will be held within one month of receipt of the written reports of all of the Examiners, unless the Campus Committee in any particular case otherwise decides.
- 32. Candidates will be required to present themselves for any oral, practical or written examinations at such place, time and date as shall be notified to them by the Campus Registrar in writing.
- 33. An oral examination shall be Chaired by a senior academic appointed by the Campus Committee and shall be conducted simultaneously by at least two examiners.  One of the examiners shall be the Supervisor of the candidate, unless the Board for Graduate Studies and Research in any particular case otherwise decides.  The Board for Graduate Studies and Research may, at  its  discretion,  appoint  examiners specifically for the oral examination.
- 34. The Chairman of the oral examination and the examiners shall send a report on the oral examination to the Board for Graduate Studies and Research in which they shall report on the candidate's knowledge of his or her field of study and make a recommendation in accordance with the relevant clauses of

- these Regulations. The report should provide the Board with the details of any further changes required of the candidate by the examiners before recommending the award of the degree.
- 35. Candidates who fail  to  present  themselves  for  any  oral  or written examination, or who fail to resubmit a revised thesis within the time periods specified in these Regulations, will be deemed to have failed the examination.
