## Revitalizing Caribbean Development

Fine universities are not established and funded to  serve  themselves  but  to  commit  to  engage  the challenges facing their host communities. In this regard the  primary  mandate  of  The  University  of  the  West Indies (The UWI) is to serve in the advancement of the Caribbean community and sustain its development.

The  UWI's  strategic  plan  for  the  period  2017-2022, emerges  from  such  an  understanding  of  the  role  of the  University  within  its  national,  regional  and  global environments.  But  the  quality  of  its  survival  as  the premiere  regional  academy  is  a  prerequisite  to  its effective service. Keeping its house in good operational order  is  necessary  to  empower  the  community  and the  world  beyond.  The  plan,  therefore,  captures  the multilayered meaning of the University's mission.

Academic and entrepreneurial empowerment through teaching  and  learning,  and  rekindling  the  agenda  of applied research and professional training are critical to building the region's resilience and promoting the praxis of relentlessly pursuing sustainable development. The urgency  of  this  is  evident  from  a  clear  reading  of  the regional  context  which  shows  the  slow  and  sluggish economic recovery from the global financial recession.

Deemed  the Triple  A  Strategy , this  plan  rests  upon three  primary  pillars: Access , Alignment ,  and Agility . Wealth  creation  and  reduction  of  social  inequality through  greater  and  more  affordable access ,  efficient and  effective alignment with  society  and  economy, and enhanced agility in pursuit of opportunities are the strategic  goals  residing  at  the  plan's  core.  The  greater

relevance  and  persistent  pedagogical  dignity  of  the University  depend  upon  the  strengthening  of  these pillars of service and survival.

No plan can stand without a culture of accountability that holds each in an effective orbit to all. Mentoring, monitoring  and  measuring  are  the  frames  that  hold each pillar upright. Community engagement for development  therefore  results  from  the  practice  of personal passion and performance progress. The collective  outcome  will  rekindle  the  activist  academy that  addresses  the  regional  agenda  in  the  context of each national community that constitutes the Caribbean world.

This Triple A Strategy , then, is a plan perfectly suited to the period imagined and engaged. It is conceived within the continuing context of sustained public service and persistent  institutional  excellence  and  endurance.  To propel the people of the region along a progressive and prosperous path is both the University's intention and its salvation.

## About The Triple A Strategy Identity

The black mortarboard represents strength, seriousness and authority, illustrating that at the helm of the Triple A Strategy is a powerful, regional, academic institution with a rich legacy that has impacted the world for 70 years.

In the game of cricket-known to unite Caribbean people and the world-grounded stumps support the bails of a wicket. So too the three pillars which represent Access , Alignment and Agility provide The UWI's foundation through its next strategic phase and are critical to the survival of the institution and by extension the Caribbean. The green colour represents the institution-wide positioning of the Triple A Strategy . It also represents life, growth and hope and symbolizes the confidence that a more accessible , aligned and agile UWI can indeed lead the revitalization of Caribbean development.

## An Interdependent Relationship

This  is  the  fifth  iteration  of  the  institution's  formal involvement in strategic planning exercises, with its  first  strategic  plan  authored  in  1997.  Since  then, the external environment within which The UWI operates  has  changed  drastically,  especially  with  the implementation  of  the  General  Agreement  on  Trade in  Services  (GATS)  by  the  World  Trade  Organization (WTO).  Using  Porterian  analysis  (Five  Forces  Model  of Industry  Competition)  as  the  lens  through  which  to view the operating environment in which The UWI now conducts its affairs, the model shows that the barriers to entry into the higher education sector have reduced significantly, mainly due to liberalization of the sector. Students, the main buyers of The UWI's services, now have more tertiary education choices. Similarly, faculty and staff, the main suppliers of The UWI's core business offerings-Teaching, Learning and Research-have also become more mobile. Further, the level of substitutes as proxied by the modalities students use to participate in  higher  education,  has  grown  exponentially  (e.g.  an increase in online versus face to face offerings). With all these  forces  working  together,  the  logical  conclusion is that the environment  for  higher  education  has become hyper-competitive at the national, regional and international level.

An environmental scan of the number of players in the higher education industry across the Caribbean shows that  there  are  over  50  institutions  offering  tertiary educational opportunities to the population. Coupled with  this  intense  competition  in  the  market  is  the increasing number of national institutions that are also competing with The UWI for funding from their national

governments. All these changes are happening at a time when the fiscal situation in almost all the countries of the  region  make  for  uncomfortable  reading.  The  twin problem of high debt and anaemic growth in national output  (Gross  Domestic  Product  (GDP))  narrows  the fiscal space from which national governments can fund higher educational institutions.

The UWI has formulated a strategic plan for the period 2017-2022 that not only seeks to ensure its own survival but  one  geared  towards  assisting  Caribbean  nations to  move  to  higher  levels  of  economic  growth  and development.  This  plan  is  based  on  the  fundamental assumption that without strong Caribbean economies, The  UWI  will  not  be  strong  and  similarly,  without  a strong  UWI,  Caribbean  economies  will  find  it  more challenging  to  achieve  significantly  higher  levels  of economic  growth  and  transformation.  Put  differently, this plan recognizes the symbiotic relationship between The  UWI  and  Caribbean  economies,  and  the  need for  both  to  work  closely  together  to  strengthen  the competitive position of regional economies.

## The UWI Triple A Strategy

The  UWI  Triple  A  Strategy:  Revitalizing  Caribbean Development captures  The  UWI's  strategic  response to  its  current  operational  environment.  It  embodies the institution's choices decided upon in order to fulfill its  mission  and  vision.  It  shows  how  the  University will  utilize  its  resources  and  capabilities  over  the  next five  years  in  order  to  achieve  maximum  outcome  in the  quest  to revitalize  Caribbean  development while ensuring its own long-term survival.

The Triple A Strategy is  grounded upon three primary pillars or strategic goals:

## 1. ACCESS

Increasing participation in tertiary and higher education for all with the capacity and desire to learn. This  will  involve,  among  other  things,  ensuring  that The UWI offerings (e.g. teaching and learning, student development, consulting, research and public advocacy programmes)  reach  the  underserved  and  diaspora Caribbean populations and all others with an interest in higher education on all continents.

## 2. ALIGNMENT

Building  relevant  and  value-added  relationships  with alumni  and  the  producers  of  wealth  and  promoting government and non-government sectors and international partners by ensuring that The UWI offerings are fulfilling the needs of the society it serves.

## 3. AGILITY

The UWI using its resources (human and physical) and capabilities  to  respond  to  the  needs  of  customers,

including alumni, in a changing environment, creating an entrepreneurial university with a diversified revenue  base,  improving  the  global  presence  of  the University  ensuring  economic  sustainability  through global expansion, operational efficiencies and financial profitability.

These  strategic  goals  serve  as  the  guiding  framework for  organizing  The  UWI's  priorities  over  the  next  five years.  While  each  strategic  goal  includes  a  myriad  of possibilities that the institution can  pursue,  given its  limited  resources  and  capabilities,  it  has  to  make choices about which will be pursued over the planning period. As such, 12 high-level objectives are identified over the period 2017-2022.

Measurable outcomes are an important part of strategic planning.  As such, attached to each strategic objective at the University-level, are Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)  that  will  be  used  to  measure  the  progress  that the University is making towards the achievement of its mission and vision. There are 18 high-level KPIs set for the period 2017-2022.

UWI GRAD

The implementation of the Triple A Strategy is  geared towards  producing  ideal  UWI  graduates  who  will  use their  skills  to  help  in  the  revitalization  of  Caribbean development.

## Key Attributes of the Ideal UWI Graduate

- 1. A critical and creative thinker
- 2.   An effective communicator with good interpersonal skills
- 3. IT-skilled and information literate
- 4. Innovative and entrepreneurial
- 5.   Globally aware and well-grounded in his/ her regional identity
- 6.   Socially, culturally and environmentally responsible
- 7. Guided by strong ethical values

## What does it mean?

Critical and creative thinker: Graduates must be able to apply analytic thought and logical reasoning to a body of knowledge and to clarify the assumptions, reasoning and  evidence  of  a  specific  issue  and  apply  scientific principles. Key functions include generating alternative ideas,  practices  and  solutions  that  are  unique  and effective, and  exploring  ways  to  confront  complex and ambiguous problems and provide solutions.

They  must  be  aware  of  global  events  and be  knowledgeable  and  open  minded  and  willing  to contribute to political, social, economic, environmental and cultural issues; nationally, regionally and globally.

Socially, culturally and environmentally responsible: Graduates  must  be  able  to  acknowledge  the  social, cultural and environmental implications of their actions and  be  guided  accordingly.  He/she  should  recognize social  justice  issues  with  particular  reference,  but  not limited, to his/her discipline and professional area.

Guided  by  strong  ethical  values: Graduates  should champion  respect,  and  understand  and  apply  ethical practices and values personally and professionally in all aspects of life.

## Implementation Framework

Although the planning cycle covers a five-year period, The UWI will implement the Triple A Strategy on a yearly basis,  as  it  tries  to  effectively  use  its  scarce  resources and capabilities over the next five years. There are 38 high-level  initiatives  identified  for  implementation  in year one of the five-year plan.

Each initiative has a number of critical tasks and activities that must be achieved in order to realize the outcomes for  The  UWI.  An  electronic  balanced  scorecard  will  be used as the management tool to monitor, evaluate and report  on  the  plan.  These  scorecards  will  be  built  at both  the  campus-level  and  the  wider  University-level to monitor progress on initiatives, risks and outcomes. Planning Officers on each campus will be responsible for uploading  data  into an integrated information system which will be used to monitor performance on a quarterly basis.

## Accountability and Ownership

Each Campus Principal will be the overall owner of the campus-level  scorecard  while  at  the  University-level, the  Vice-Chancellor  and  the  Executive  Management Team will own the scorecard. The Vice-Chancellor will also be the overall owner of the Regional Headquarters (RHQ) scorecard.

The scorecards are built with an accountability framework  in  place.  At  the  campus  level,  although the Campus Principal is ultimately responsible for the scorecard,  Deans  will  have  direct  responsibility  for faculty scorecards and heads of departments will have

responsibility  for  departmental  scorecards,  which  will all  be  aggregated  to  produce  the  campus  scorecard. Similarly, administrators such as Registrars, Bursars, Pro Vice-Chancellors,  etc.,  will  have  scorecards,  designed along the lines of their executive reporting relationships, which feed into campus-level and University-level scorecards.  This  overall  accountability  and  ownership will be key to the effective implementation of the Triple A Strategy .

University  and  campus  balanced  scorecards  will  be reviewed  annually  but  monitored  quarterly.  At  the annual  reviews,  modification  can  be  made  to  targets and indicators, where appropriate.

For  effective  implementation,  the  scorecards  will  be linked to the annual performance reviews of the initiative owners. The University and campus senior management teams  will  provide  operational  governance  over  the strategic  plan  to  ensure  its  effectiveness.  They  will  be supported by the various committees and work groups that will be established to execute various initiatives.
